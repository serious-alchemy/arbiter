# Arbiter

**Arbiter** is an AI-driven ticket tracker and autonomous coding agent harness. It coordinates work across your projects through a CLI (`arb`), MCP tools for a coordinator agent, and a LiveView dashboard. Tasks are tracked as **tickets**, dispatched to **worker** agents for autonomous execution in isolated git worktrees, and merged through a **ReviewGate** and **merge queue** for code quality and safety.

## Prerequisites

- **Elixir 1.19+ / Erlang 28+** — [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is the
  recommended way to install. With mise installed:

      mise install

  (The `.tool-versions` file in this repo pins the exact versions.)

Arbiter's datastore is **SQLite** — no database server or Docker is required.

## Install (development)

```sh
# 1. Clone
git clone <repo-url> arbiter
cd arbiter

# 2. Install dependencies, run migrations, seed the default workspace
mix setup

# 3. Build and install the arb CLI onto your PATH
arb install cli
```

`arb install cli` builds the CLI escript from `apps/arbiter_cli` and installs
it to `~/.local/bin/arb`. If `~/.local/bin` isn't in your PATH yet, add this
to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) and restart your terminal:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Since `arb install cli` itself depends on `arb` already being on your PATH the
very first time, bootstrap it once by hand:

```sh
cd apps/arbiter_cli && mix escript.build && cd ../..
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && cp apps/arbiter_cli/arb ~/.local/bin/
```

Re-run `arb install cli` any time you pull changes to `apps/arbiter_cli`.

## Architecture

**Workspaces** — isolated coordination scopes. A workspace holds a set of tickets, dispatch policies, and tooling configuration. An installation can run multiple workspaces side by side, each with its own repos, tracker, and merge settings.

**Repos** — registered git repositories. Workers check out code on repos to work on tickets.

**Tickets** — tasks to be worked (formerly *issues*; `arb issue` and the `task_*` MCP tools remain as deprecated aliases for one release). Can be tracked in an external system (Jira, GitHub, Linear) or managed locally. A ticket moves through one lifecycle state: backlog → queued (Ready) → active (In progress) → merging → verifying → closed.

**Workers** — autonomous agents spawned via Claude Code (or future adapters) to work a ticket. Each worker receives a ticket, works it in an isolated git worktree, and reports completion with a PR or notes. Their full transcript is retained for audit and learning.

**ReviewGate** — optional quality checkpoint. A second Claude agent reviews the worker's work before merging. Can be disabled per-ticket.

**Merge queue** — batches approved changes and applies them to the repo in sequence. Handles merge conflicts, CI status checks, and rollback on failure.

**PRPatrol** — polls open PRs per repo and dispatches follow-up workers when a review needs a response (changes requested, unresolved review threads, or failing required checks).

**Watchdog** — polls a merge request's fate for a worker parked at `:awaiting_review` and drives the worker to its terminal state (merged, closed/rejected, or auto-merged).

**Escalation mailbox** — the coordinator's inbox for anything that needs a human or coordinator ruling (e.g. a ReviewGate escalation, a worker failure). Read it via `arb message inbox` or the `inbox_check` / `notify_list` MCP tools.

**`/events`** — a server-push event stream (`GET /events`) for the coordinator: newline-delimited JSON, one event per line, for topics like `inbox`, `review_gate`, `worker_failed`, `worker_done`, and (opt-in) `task_state` / `external_review`. Every event carries a `"cursor"`; pass `since=<cursor|timestamp>` to replay what was missed since a disconnect before rejoining the live stream (see `ArbiterWeb.Api.EventController` moduledoc).

## Coordinating via MCP

The primary integration path for a coordinator agent (e.g. a dedicated Claude Code session) is the `arbiter` MCP server, which exposes tools like `ticket_show`, `ticket_create`, `ticket_list`, `worker_dispatch`, `worker_resume`, `worker_review`, `worker_list`, `worker_log`, `inbox_check`, `message_send`, `notify_list`, `workspace_show`, `workspace_config_get/set`, `quota_get`, `run_log_list`, `transcript_capture_stats`, and `usage_summarize`, plus whole tool categories beyond one-off ticket dispatch:

- **Skills** — `skill_list`/`skill_get`/`skill_create`/`skill_update`/`skill_delete` for managing reusable skill content.
- **Dependencies + scheduler** — `dep_add`/`dep_remove`/`dep_list` to wire tickets together with `depends_on`/`blocks`/`conflicts_with` edges, and `scheduler_pause`/`scheduler_resume`/`scheduler_status` to control the board scheduler (Autopilot) that auto-dispatches Ready cards in edge order. A pause stops new board dispatches only — fix passes, conflict resolvers and review rounds already under way keep running — so `scheduler_status` reports a drain state (`running` / `draining` with what is in flight / `quiescent`, the only safe restart point); `arb scheduler pause && arb scheduler wait` blocks until it is safe to restart. Chains of tickets run by declaring the edges, not by building a separate graph object.
- **ExternalReview** — `external_review_list`, `external_review_show`, `external_review_transcript`, `review_greenlight` for inspecting and unblocking worktree-backed external code review. `external_review_transcript` is `worker_log`'s counterpart for a review: the prompt it was given, the raw transcript its reviewer emitted, and every tool call paired with its result — keyed on the review record id, since an external review is not ticket-linked.

See `apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/mcp/catalog.ex` for the full, current catalog and which tier (worker vs. coordinator) can call each tool.

To mint a token for a coordinator to use:

```sh
arb mcp token mint --tier coordinator
```

The server speaks MCP over **Streamable HTTP** at `http://127.0.0.1:4848/mcp`,
so configure a client with `"type": "http"` (Claude Code), `httpUrl` (Gemini
CLI) or a plain `url` (Codex CLI), and pass the token as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arbiter": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:4848/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <coordinator-token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

Streamable HTTP is the **only** transport `/mcp` serves. The deprecated HTTP+SSE
transport (2024-11-05, Claude Code's `"type": "sse"`) is not served: a client
configured that way POSTs `initialize` and then waits for the reply on the SSE
stream, which never arrives, so it times out and reports the server as down. Use
`"type": "http"` — which is what `arb init` and worker dispatch write. The
`GET /mcp` SSE stream still exists, but only as Streamable HTTP's server →
client channel (server-initiated messages and keepalives); it requires a
coordinator token.

## Quick-start

### 1. Start the server

```sh
arb server start
```

The dashboard is at **http://127.0.0.1:4848**.

### 2. Configure a workspace

Visit the dashboard's **Workspace** page and configure:
- **Repos** (projects to work in)
- Worker/agent settings — model tier map, per-thinking-level args, provider overrides, and credentials (`agent.config.*`)
- Security policy (`agent.security.*`)
- Rate-limit throttling (`quota.*`) and per-workspace worker concurrency (`conductor.max_concurrent` — the key name is historical)
- Optionally a **tracker** (Jira, GitHub, Linear) and merge strategy

Or edit `config/dev.exs` directly and restart the server, or use `arb config set`.

### 3. Dispatch your first ticket

Create and dispatch a ticket via the dashboard or CLI:

```sh
arb ticket create "Fix typo in README"
arb ticket dispatch <id> my-project
```

Watch the worker in the dashboard, or tail the transcript:

```sh
arb worker log <task-id>
```

Once complete, the merge queue picks it up (if configured) or you can merge manually via the dashboard.

### Running as a systemd service

To run Arbiter as a self-contained OTP release under a systemd user unit, install and enable it with:

```sh
arb install service
```

This writes `~/.config/systemd/user/arbiter.service` (`ExecStart=~/.arbiter/current/bin/arbiter start`), enables it via `loginctl enable-linger` for machine-boot startup, and starts the release. Manage it with `systemctl --user status arbiter.service` and view logs with `journalctl --user -u arbiter.service -f`. Pass `--system` to install a system-wide unit instead (needs root). Secrets and PATH configuration live in `~/.arbiter/arbiter.env`. Uninstall with `arb install service --uninstall`.

`arb install service` only writes the release-shaped unit above. There is no
CLI command yet for a dev-mode unit (one whose `ExecStart` runs
`mix phx.server` instead of a release binary) — on a source checkout you hand-write
that unit file yourself; see [Deploying: pick the path for your install
shape](#deploying-pick-the-path-for-your-install-shape) below.

### Deploying: pick the path for your install shape

Arbiter supports two install shapes, and the deploy command differs between
them:

- **Source checkout (dev mode)** — a git clone with `mix phx.server` run
  directly (by hand, or supervised by a systemd user unit that points
  `ExecStart` at `mix phx.server` rather than a release binary). This is how
  the "Install (development)" section above sets things up, and how this
  repo's own coordinator instance runs today — the releases strategy is
  scoped but not yet built (see #754 for the history: `arb server deploy`
  used to hard-require `ARB_RELEASE_REPO` and dead-end on a dev-mode install;
  it now detects the missing env var and falls back automatically).
- **OTP release install** — a built release artifact unpacked under
  `~/.arbiter/releases/<tag>/`, installed via `arb install service`. No
  source checkout or Elixir/Mix toolchain on the box.

If you're on a source checkout, use the sequence below. If you have a release
artifact installed, skip to [OTP-release installs](#production-deploys-otp-release-installs).

#### Source checkout (dev mode)

```sh
git fetch origin main
git diff --name-only HEAD origin/main -- mix.lock   # non-empty → deps changed; see note below
arb server deploy --git-pull
arb server doctor     # confirm CLI and server report the same version
```

`arb server deploy --git-pull` does the pull → rebuild → restart → migrate
sequence for you: `git pull --ff-only` on `main`, rebuild and install the CLI
escript if `apps/arbiter_cli` changed, then restart Phoenix — via
`systemctl --user restart arbiter` when the systemd unit is present, a plain
process bounce otherwise. The restart's boot sequence (`Boot.Migrator`)
applies any pending migrations before the endpoint opens, so migrations are
never run against the live server. **Do not `git pull` by hand first** — the
command diffs `before_sha`/`after_sha` itself and treats an already-current
tree as "nothing to deploy," skipping the restart and escript rebuild
entirely.

It also does **not** run `mix deps.get` for you. If the pre-check above
printed a `mix.lock` line, the pulled tree needs new deps that the restart
will not have — running `mix deps.get` *before* the pull is a no-op, since
`git fetch` doesn't move `HEAD` and the old lockfile is still checked out.
Instead, either run `mix deps.get && arb server restart` immediately *after*
the deploy, or skip `--git-pull` and do the whole thing manually: `git pull
--ff-only origin main` → `mix deps.get` → `(cd apps/arbiter_cli && mix
escript.build && cp arb ~/.local/bin/arb)` if `apps/arbiter_cli` changed →
`arb server restart` → `arb server doctor`. The manual form is the safer
choice when deps changed, since it never restarts against unfetched deps.

A bare `arb server deploy` (no flags) does the same git-pull fallback
automatically whenever `ARB_RELEASE_REPO` is unset, but prefer the explicit
`--git-pull` form on a source checkout so the command's behavior doesn't
depend silently on an environment variable you may not have set on purpose.

#### Production deploys: OTP-release installs

This subsection only applies once you have a built release artifact
installed (`arb install service`, or manually under
`~/.arbiter/releases/<tag>/`) — **not** to a source checkout; use
[the sequence above](#source-checkout-dev-mode) for that. `~/.arbiter/current`
is symlinked atomically to the active release. Deploy a specific version (or
`latest`) with:

```sh
arb server deploy --version v1.2.3
```

This downloads the release tarball + checksum from GitHub Releases (`ARB_RELEASE_REPO`), verifies the SHA-256, unpacks it, atomically swaps `current`, restarts the service, and health-checks it — auto-rolling back to the last-known-good release if it doesn't come back green.

#### Migration ordering, and rollback across a migration

**The deploy does not run migrations.** SQLite allows exactly one writer, so a
`bin/arbiter eval Arbiter.Release.migrate` from the new release while the old
server is still serving would be a second writer racing the live one. Instead
the new release migrates during its **own boot**: `Arbiter.Boot.Migrator` is a
synchronous supervision-tree child that brings the schema to head before
`ArbiterWeb.Endpoint` binds its port, gated on the single-instance advisory
lock so only one node ever migrates. The real ordering is therefore:

    stop the old server  →  new release boots  →  migrate  →  serve

— one writer at every instant, and the same path `arb server restart`,
`arb server migrate` and dev `mix phx.server` already take. The dev-mode
fallback (`arb server deploy --git-pull`) obeys the same ordering: with the
server up it pulls and restarts, and the pulled migrations are applied by that
boot; it only migrates standalone when the server is already down.

**Auto-rollback stops at a schema change.** Re-pointing `current` back at the
prior release after the new one has migrated would run old code against a
schema it has never seen. Before swapping the symlink, the deploy compares the
migrations packaged into the new release tree
(`lib/<app>-<vsn>/priv/repo/migrations`) against those in the release it would
roll back to — a pure filesystem comparison, no database connection. If the new
release adds any:

- it says so up-front, naming them, and notes that automatic rollback is disabled;
- on a health-check failure it **refuses** to roll back, leaves `current` on the
  new release, names the crossed migrations, and exits non-zero with the
  operator's options (fix forward, or roll the schema back first with
  `bin/arbiter eval "Arbiter.Release.rollback(Arbiter.Repo, <version>)"` and then
  `arb server deploy --version <prior> --force`);
- `--allow-cross-migration-rollback` overrides the refusal, rolling back anyway
  with a loud warning that the prior release is now on a newer schema.

A deploy that adds no migrations keeps the automatic rollback unchanged — but
only when detection actually worked. Because an arbiter release always ships
migrations, an *empty* migration set from the new release tree means the globs
no longer match the packaging layout, not that the deploy is migration-free.
That case fails closed: the deploy warns up-front, refuses the automatic
rollback the same way a crossed migration does, and reports
`migrations_detected: false` in `--json` so the empty `crossed_migrations` list
can't be mistaken for "safe". `--allow-cross-migration-rollback` overrides it.

When the refusal comes from a **failed swap** (`/api/version` still reports the
old release) rather than a green-wait timeout, the message says the new
release's migrations *may* have been applied rather than claiming they were —
a release that never booted never ran its boot migrator.

### Server bind address (`ARB_BIND_ADDRESS`)

The dashboard's auth model is "a loopback peer is trusted; there is no login" —
LiveView pages, including a terminal into every worker session, have no
credential check beyond "did this request come from the same box". Because of
that, **the server binds to `127.0.0.1:4848` by default** in both dev and
prod/release, in dev and runtime config alike.

**Upgrade note:** before this change, the default was `0.0.0.0`
(dev)/`[::]` (prod) — reachable from the LAN, or the internet on a cloud host
with a permissive security group. An install that relied on that for remote
access will stop being reachable after upgrading. Use an SSH port-forward
instead (`ssh -L 4848:127.0.0.1:4848 <host>`), which needs no server-side
change; or, if off-loopback really is required, set `ARB_BIND_ADDRESS`
explicitly (below) — `arb server doctor` will keep warning about it every time
as a reminder of the exposure.

To bind elsewhere, set `ARB_BIND_ADDRESS` to any address `:inet.parse_address/1`
accepts (e.g. `0.0.0.0`, `::`, a specific interface IP):

```sh
echo "ARB_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0" >> ~/.arbiter/arbiter.env
```

Any non-loopback value logs a boot `WARNING` naming the exposure, and
`arb server doctor` reports a non-fatal warning check pointing back here.

### Remote `arb` — access Arbiter over VPN

By default, `arb` talks to a local server on `http://127.0.0.1:4848` (loopback). To point `arb` at a remote Arbiter server:

1. **Set `ARB_HOST`** to your server's URL over VPN:

   ```sh
   export ARB_HOST="http://arbiter.internal.example.com"
   # or export ARB_HOST="https://arbiter.example.com" for HTTPS
   ```

2. **Mint a token** on the server:

   ```sh
   arb mcp token mint --tier coordinator
   ```

3. **Export the token** on the client:

   ```sh
   export ARB_TOKEN="<token-from-step-2>"
   ```

4. **Verify the connection**:

   ```sh
   arb prime
   ```

- **Local loopback** (`ARB_HOST` unset or `http://127.0.0.1:4848`) requires no `ARB_TOKEN` — the server exempts localhost.
- **Remote access** requires both `ARB_HOST` and `ARB_TOKEN`, *and* the server
  must be reachable at that address in the first place — since the server now
  binds loopback-only by default (above), that means either `ARB_BIND_ADDRESS`
  set server-side, or reaching it through an SSH port-forward / VPN tunnel that
  terminates on `127.0.0.1` locally. The API's own token check is unaffected
  either way; only the dashboard's login-free LiveView pages are the reason to
  prefer a tunnel over a raw `ARB_BIND_ADDRESS` override.

### Encryption key (`ARBITER_CLOAK_KEY`) — required

Arbiter encrypts workspace secrets (tracker / merger credentials) at rest using
AES-256-GCM via [`ash_cloak`](https://hex.pm/packages/ash_cloak). **The server
refuses to start without an encryption key.** Generate a 32-byte Base64 key and
add it to your environment before deploying:

```sh
echo "ARBITER_CLOAK_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> ~/.arbiter/arbiter.env
# (for a non-service run, put it in the project-root .arbiter.env or export it)
```

`arb install service` forwards `ARBITER_CLOAK_KEY` from the installing shell
into `~/.arbiter/arbiter.env` automatically if it is set. Treat this key like a
database password: back it up and keep it stable — rotating it (re-encrypting
existing secrets) is a separate runbook and is not yet automated. Losing it
makes existing encrypted secrets unrecoverable.

### Claude CLI authentication (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) — required

Real worker spawns and the `CredentialWatchdog`'s health probe both authenticate
the `claude` CLI via `Arbiter.Agents.Claude.spawn_env/1`, and a Claude worker
needs a credential of its own: a setup token (`claude setup-token`) or an
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Arbiter **never** copies your own
`~/.claude/.credentials.json` into a worker — Claude rotates that login's refresh
token on every refresh, so a second holder locks one of you out. A Claude
dispatch for a workspace with no credential is refused and held (its tickets stay
Ready), the coordinator gets one escalation naming the fix, and
`arb server doctor`'s "claude worker credentials" check lists every such
workspace. The supported path is
**provider accounts** — a `provider_accounts` row, joined to a workspace via
`workspace_provider_accounts`, holding an active `provider_credentials` row for
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (`docs/provider-account-design.md`) — and since the
P13 flip it is the only one. A spawn with a workspace takes its account's
credential; a workspace-less spawn such as the Watchdog probe takes the
install's single enabled Claude account credential. A token in a workspace's
`worker_env` or in the server's own environment (`.arbiter.env`) is **not**
read. `spawn_env/1` exports the token under its own literal name (never
remapped to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — the two are not interchangeable to the CLI),
and emits an explicit unset when there is none, so a server-env value can
never leak into a worker.

**Migrating an install that still keeps its token in `worker_env` or
`.arbiter.env`:** `mix arbiter.accounts.census` only ever sees credentials
already stored in a workspace's `worker_env` (`docs/provider-account-design.md`
§7.1) — it has no visibility into the arbiter server's own process
environment, so a token that has only ever lived in `.arbiter.env` will not
appear in the census output at all. Migrate **before** upgrading to the P13
release, which requires provider accounts:

1. Set the token as a `worker_env` value (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) on at
   least one workspace via the dashboard's workspace environment editor, so
   `mix arbiter.accounts.census` has something to fingerprint.
2. Run `mix arbiter.accounts.census` (optionally with
   `--operator-credential ~/.claude/.credentials.json`), edit the resulting
   plan to merge/name the candidate account, then apply it with
   `mix arbiter.accounts.migrate --plan accounts.json`, and restart.
3. Remove `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (and any `ARBITER_PROVIDER_ACCOUNTS` line)
   from `.arbiter.env` / the service unit — nothing reads them, and a stale
   credential lying around in a secrets file is its own risk.

On a **release install** (no Mix), the same census, migrate and rollback steps
run as `bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.accounts_census(...)'`,
`accounts_migrate/1` and `accounts_rollback/1`.
[`docs/provider-accounts-release-runbook.md`](docs/provider-accounts-release-runbook.md)
is the step-by-step procedure (census, dry run, migrate, restart, verify), the
P13 release notes, and the rollback.

#### Account-model path

You can also manage provider accounts directly via the `arb account` CLI
instead of (or alongside) the census/migrate flow above:

```sh
# Create or reference a provider account
arb account create claude my_account

# Attach it to a workspace
arb account attach <workspace> claude my_account

# Install or rotate the credential
arb account rotate claude:my_account --kind oauth_token --env-var CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN --secret <your-long-ttl-token>
```

This path is particularly useful if you have **multiple Claude credentials**
(e.g., for different Anthropic accounts or organizations) and want to route
different workspaces to different accounts — the account model lets each
workspace reference its own account identity directly, without duplicating
tokens across workspaces or relying on install-wide environment fallbacks.

**Precedence when both are set:** a spawn can end up with both
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (the account's) and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (workspace
`credentials_ref`/`api_keys` rotation) in its environment at once. Which one
the `claude` CLI honours is decided by the CLI itself, not by Arbiter — if it
prefers the OAuth token, a workspace that deliberately configured its own key
would silently authenticate against the account credential instead. If a
workspace's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must win, verify the CLI's actual precedence
before relying on it, or leave that workspace's Claude account without a
setup token.

**Redaction:** `Arbiter.Worker.ClaudeSession.start/1` adds
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` values to the session's
redaction list alongside the workspace's secret-flagged `worker_env` values —
both the values carried in the spawn's explicit `:env` (the Dispatch/
ReviewGate path) and, for the `start/1` callers that pass no `:env` at all
(the conflict-resolver and CI fix-pass workers, which still inherit the
install-wide OS environment via `Port.open`'s `{:env, …}` extension
semantics), the value read directly from the OS environment. So the token is
scrubbed from worker output (`worker_runs.output_lines`, the live dashboard
stream, the durable output log) across all `ClaudeSession.start/1` callers,
even after the per-workspace `worker_env` copies are removed.

### Storing tracker / merger credentials in the database

Instead of pointing `credentials_ref` at an environment variable
(`credentials_ref: "env:SHORTCUT_API_TOKEN"`), you can store the token directly
on the workspace, encrypted at rest, and reference it with a `secret:` ref. This
needs no server-side env var and no restart:

```sh
# 1. store the encrypted secret on the workspace
arb workspace secret set tracker_token sct_rw_...

# 2. point the tracker config at it
arb config set tracker.config.credentials_ref secret:tracker_token

# inspect / remove (values are never shown — only key names)
arb workspace secret ls
arb workspace secret rm tracker_token
```

Existing `env:` refs keep working unchanged, so you can migrate one workspace at
a time. Secret **values** are never returned by the API or CLI — only the key
names are listed.

## Initialize your coordinator session

A **coordinator** is a dedicated Claude Code session that directs work across
a workspace — creating and dispatching tickets, reviewing worker output, and
resolving escalations — typically via the MCP tools above. It has its own
working directory with persistent memory and a notes folder.

```sh
mkdir ~/coordinator && cd ~/coordinator
arb init         # initializes the current directory
```

Or pass a path to initialize elsewhere:

```sh
arb init ~/my-coordinator
cd ~/my-coordinator
```

Then open Claude Code:

```sh
claude
```

The coordinator session will check whether the server is running, start it if
needed, orient itself with `arb prime`, and be ready to coordinate your work.

## Adding repos (projects)

A **repo** is a local git repository that workers check out and work in. Register your projects via the dashboard (Workspace → Repos), or directly in `config/dev.exs`:

```elixir
config :arbiter, :repo_paths, %{
  "my-project" => Path.expand("~/dev/my-project"),
  "another-project" => Path.expand("~/dev/another-project")
}
```

After editing `config/dev.exs`, restart the server for changes to take effect.

## CLI Reference

The CLI uses an `arb <resource> <verb>` grammar: `arb [resource] verb [args]`.
Run `arb help` (or `arb --help`) for the exhaustive, always-current usage text
(`apps/arbiter_cli/lib/arbiter_cli/main.ex`); the table below covers the
commands you'll reach for most.

### Key commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `arb prime` | Mission briefing — run at session start to check workspace status |
| `arb ticket list` | List tickets in the workspace |
| `arb ticket show <id>` | View a ticket's details and history |
| `arb ticket create <title>` | Create a new ticket |
| `arb ticket dispatch <id> [repo]` | Dispatch a worker to work on a ticket |
| `arb worker list` | List running and completed workers |
| `arb worker log <task-id>` | Read a worker's full transcript (durable) |
| `arb worker review <task-id>` | Dispatch a review-only worker against a ticket |
| `arb message inbox` | Read (and mark read) the coordinator's escalation mailbox |
| `arb server start` | Boot the stack (no-op if already up) |
| `arb server deploy [--version vX.Y.Z]` | Deploy an OTP release from GitHub Releases (auto-rollback on failure, refused across a migration) |
| `arb server deploy --git-pull` | Source-checkout deploy: `git pull --ff-only`, rebuild the CLI if changed, restart (see [Deploying](#deploying-pick-the-path-for-your-install-shape)) |
| `arb server doctor` | Health-check the server and database |
| `arb config get/set [workspace]` | Read/edit workspace configuration (tracker, merger, etc.) |
| `arb mcp token mint --tier coordinator` | Mint an MCP token for a coordinator session |

All commands accept `--help` and `--json` for structured output. Pre-`<resource> <verb>`
flat commands from earlier CLI versions (`arb list`, `arb start`, `arb doctor`, …) still
run — they print a one-line note pointing at the new form. (`arb dispatch <id>` is a
permanent top-level shortcut for `arb ticket dispatch <id>`, not a legacy alias.)
