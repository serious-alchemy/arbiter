# Arbiter Operator Guide

Operating knowledge for the coordinator seat. Generic — applies to any Arbiter
install. Update it as you learn.

Run `arb prime` at the start of every session. It prints each workspace's
tickets in lifecycle order — Needs attention, In progress, Merging, Verifying,
Ready, Blocked, and a Backlog count — so the first section is always the work
that is waiting on someone (see §1a).

---

## 1. Role & Loop

You coordinate; the workers execute. Core loop:

1. File an issue with crisp acceptance criteria, difficulty, and priority. It
   starts in **Backlog**; `arb promote <id>` queues it (Ready, or Blocked while a
   gating blocker is open).
2. Dispatch to a repo (`arb dispatch <id> [<repo>]`), or let Autopilot take the
   head of Ready. The ticket moves to **In progress**.
3. Monitor — `arb prime` / `arb worker show <id>` / `arb worker list`. Work the
   **Needs attention** section first.
4. Review gate (pre-merge) escalates for your judgment; decide, don't
   rubber-stamp. A ReviewGate park is attention on the ticket (cause names the
   park reason), not a place.
5. The ticket moves to **Merging** when its PR opens, then **Closed** on merge
   — or **Verifying** first when it was flagged `verify_after_deploy`.

External comms (GitHub, Slack) stay in normal professional voice.

## 1a. Ticket lifecycle vocabulary

Every surface — the board, `arb prime`, `arb issue show`, MCP `task_show` /
`task_list` / `task_ready`, and the `task_state` event — gives the same answer
about where a ticket is. Use these terms. The legacy `status` field and the
old Backlog/Ready flag still ride along for one release, but nothing should
read them: they are being removed.

**State** — the one stored field: `backlog`, `queued`, `active`, `merging`,
`verifying`, `closed`.

**Column** — the state as the board shows it:

| state | column |
|---|---|
| `backlog` | Backlog |
| `queued` | **Blocked** (a gating blocker is still open) or **Ready** |
| `active` | In progress |
| `merging` | Merging |
| `verifying` | Verifying |
| `closed` | Closed (with a `close_reason`) |

A blocker that is Verifying (merged, waiting on its verification) no longer
blocks its dependents. Epics stay off the board and out of Ready.

**Step** — computed, never stored, and only inside two columns:

- In progress: `implementing`, `in_review`, `addressing_review`, `fixing_ci`,
  `resolving_conflict`.
- Merging: `waiting_ci`, `in_merge_queue`, `behind_base`, `merge_blocked`.

**Attention** — an overlay, not a column: `{owner, waiting_on, reason}`. The
ticket keeps its column. The coordinator owns everything the fleet can act on;
an item reaches the operator only by an explicit hand-off (`arb issue handoff
<id> --note …`) or an expired limit. Attention clears by itself when the ticket's
state moves on.

**Where to look for what:**

| you want | read |
|---|---|
| what is waiting on someone | `arb prime` → Needs attention (coordinator's first, then operator's) |
| what is working | In progress, with its step |
| what has a PR open | Merging, with its step and PR |
| what needs a restart-and-observe | Verifying → `arb issue verify <id> --observed "…"` |
| what dispatches next | Ready, in dispatch order (`arb ready`, MCP `task_ready`) |
| why a queued ticket isn't moving | Blocked, with its blockers |
| one ticket | `arb issue show <id>` — State (column), Step, Attention, Close reason, PR + merge status, Current run |
| a filtered list | MCP `task_list` with `state` or `column` |

## 2. Operating Pitfalls — Quick Reference

The six most-burned-by operating pitfalls. Check these first:

- [ ] **Concurrency** — keep concurrent tasks FILE-DISJOINT. Tasks that touch the same file (especially CLI verb list, command-alias map, or router) **will collide at merge**. The auto-conflict-resolver helps, but do not rely on it. Serialize those tasks.
- [ ] **Config** — use `arb config get/set/unset` only. **Never** send partial config via raw API PATCH — it replaces the whole map and **silently clobbers** siblings (`repo_paths`, tracker, merge config, vernacular).
- [ ] **Deploy** — before restarting the server, check for active workers (`arb prime` or `arb worker list`). **Restarting the server KILLS all in-flight workers and abandons their work.**
- [ ] **Freshness** — keep repos current. Workers branch from the repo's base branch. A stale repo means stale, possibly regressed state for every new worker.
- [ ] **Verify** — a worker can show "running" while its subprocess is dead. **Check the port/log, not just status.** A PR marked CLEAN/MERGEABLE means no merge conflict, **not** an empty diff.
- [ ] **ReviewGate** — read the full implementer↔reviewer transcript before deciding. Do not assume the worst on a stalled exchange; do not rubber-stamp because a round ran. **Decide for yourself.**

## 3. Issue Intake — Claim & Create

When taking in new issues locally via `arb claim` or `arb create`, **always
set difficulty immediately after intake**. Both commands create tasks without
prompting for difficulty, and the field defaults to unset. Difficulty drives the
model tier and thinking budget — set it before dispatching to avoid under-scoped work.

Workflow:

```bash
# Option A: Claim an existing upstream issue
arb claim 42
arb update <task-id> --difficulty <n>

# Option B: Create a new local task
arb create "Fix widget crash on startup" --description "..."
arb update <task-id> --difficulty <n>
```

Difficulty scale (D0–D5):

```
D0 Trivial  — single-file, fully specified, no judgment (typo, config, doc edit)
D1 Simple   — localized, clear approach, light reasoning; follows existing pattern
D2 Moderate — multi-file or some design choice (default if omitted)
D3 Hard     — cross-cutting, non-obvious design, correctness-critical
D4 Extreme  — novel architecture, deep ambiguity, may warrant multi-pass
D5 Flagship — a deliberate escalation, never an ordinary rating: work judged
              worth a full quota window on the flagship model. Reach for it
              only when D4 (premium model, max effort) has already failed or
              is plainly inadequate. "Harder than D4" is not a reason.
```

D5 is opt-in by design — it has to be typed. One measured D4 flagship run
consumed an entire 5h quota window in ~12 minutes for $19.62 and answered one
of six questions before being cut off, which is why the tier now sits behind a
level nothing rates automatically: trackers, story-point buckets and the
autonomous loop all stop at D4.

### Repo is required on every issue (bd-9dwbvt)

Every issue carries a repo from the moment it is created. You rarely type it:
creation resolves one in this order:

```
explicit --repo  →  the workspace's only repo  →  the workspace's default_repo
```

- Single-repo workspace: nothing to do, it fills itself in.
- Multi-repo workspace **with** `default_repo`: nothing to do.
- Multi-repo workspace **without** `default_repo`: creation is **refused**
  with an error listing the configured `repo_paths` keys. Pass `--repo <key>`,
  or set the default once: `arb config set default_repo <key>`.
- A `--repo` that is not a configured `repo_paths` key is rejected at create
  time rather than persisted for dispatch to fail on later.
- A workspace with no `repo_paths` at all still creates issues with a null
  repo — there is nothing to resolve against.

This applies to every creation path: `arb create` / `arb issue create`,
`task_create`, `arb claim` / `tracker_claim`, `arb sync` / `tracker_sync`
auto-claim, the dashboard create form, and worker-filed follow-ups. Epics,
decisions and `task`-type issues are not exempt.

Issues filed before this are backfilled with
`mix arbiter.backfill_issue_repos` on a dev/source install (dry-run by
default, `--apply` to write; re-running it is a no-op), or on a release
install with no Mix toolchain:

    bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.backfill(:issue_repos)'             # dry-run
    bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.backfill(:issue_repos, apply?: true)'

It prints, per workspace, how many rows it set and how many it left null. See
"Data backfills on a release install" in section 8 for the other four.

## 4. File Issues Well

- **Crisp acceptance criteria** — reference real files and line numbers.
- **DIFFICULTY (D0–D5)** — drives the model + thinking budget routed to the
  worker.
- **PRIORITY (P0–P4)** — drives scheduling urgency.
- They are **orthogonal** — a P0 can be D0 (trivial config bump); a P3 can be
  D4 (hard architectural change). Do not conflate them.
- Set `target_branch` when it is not the workspace default.

Drop a one-line difficulty justification in the description so reviewers can
sanity-check your call.

## 5. Concurrency Discipline

Parallel workers are good. **Keep concurrent tasks FILE-DISJOINT.**

Tasks that touch the same file — especially the CLI verb list,
command-alias map, or the router — **will collide at merge**. The
auto-conflict-resolver helps, but do not rely on it. Serialize those tasks.

## 6. Freshness

Workers branch from the repo's base branch. A stale repo means stale, possibly
regressed state for every new worker. Keep repos current; let provisioning
fetch from origin.

That auto-fetch (`Worktree.fetch_origin/2`) only refreshes the
`origin/<base>` *ref* inside a repo's primary checkout (the shared directory
in `repo_paths` — not a worker's isolated worktree). It never
touches that checkout's own local branch, HEAD, index, or working tree — so
`git log`/`git status` run directly in the primary checkout (by you, or by a
`task`-type worker reading it for context) can still show a branch that's
weeks behind `origin/main`, even though every dispatch has kept the ref
fresh. This bit a real audit: a worker read a checkout ~1 month stale and
confidently reported already-shipped work as unmerged (bd-bqqnin).

Opt a repo in to closing that gap with `config["merge"]["auto_sync_primary"]
= true` (`arb config set merge.auto_sync_primary true`, default `false`).
When set, every merge to that repo's default branch fast-forwards the
primary checkout's local branch to the new `origin/<base>` — but *only* as a
zero-risk fast-forward: the checkout must already be on the default branch,
clean (no uncommitted changes), and a strict ancestor of the new tip. Any
other state (dirty tree, checked out elsewhere, diverged history — i.e. a
human mid-work in that checkout) is skipped silently (logged, not errored);
it never resets, stashes, or switches branches out from under someone. Still
worth an explicit `git pull` if you're about to trust a primary checkout for
something high-stakes and aren't certain `auto_sync_primary` is on for that
repo.

## 7. Config Safety

Workspace config is a single JSON map stored in the database.

**NEVER** send a partial config via the raw API PATCH — it replaces the whole
map and **silently clobbers** siblings (`repo_paths`, tracker, merge config,
vernacular).

**Use `arb config get/set/unset` (deep-merge) only.**

## 8. Deploy Safely

A real deploy = pull + run migrations + rebuild the CLI escript + restart the
server.

**Restarting the server KILLS all in-flight workers** and abandons their work.
Before restarting:

1. Check for active workers (`arb prime` or `arb worker list`).
2. If any are running, wait for them to finish — or explicitly stop them first.
3. Never restart mid-flight as a shortcut.

### Never migrate a live server (SQLite has one writer)

SQLite allows exactly one writer. **Never** run a standalone migrate against a
running server — not `mix arbiter.migrate`, not
`bin/arbiter eval Arbiter.Release.migrate`. It races the live writer and fails
with `queue_timeout`, or worse, half-applies while the old code is serving.

Migration is a **boot** step: `Arbiter.Boot.Migrator` runs pending migrations
synchronously, before the endpoint opens, gated on the single-instance lock. So
every restart is also a migration run, and the ordering is always:

    stop the old server  →  new code boots  →  migrate  →  serve

`arb server deploy` (release path) relies on this: it downloads, verifies,
unpacks, swaps `current`, and restarts — it does **not** migrate itself.
`arb server migrate` against a live server redirects to a restart for the same
reason. The dev-mode path (`arb server deploy --git-pull`, which a bare
`arb server deploy` also falls back to when `ARB_RELEASE_REPO` is unset) follows
the same rule: it pulls, rebuilds the CLI if it changed, and restarts, letting
`Boot.Migrator` apply the pulled migrations on boot. It runs a standalone
`mix arbiter.migrate` only when the server is already down — no live writer to
race. If you want to migrate by hand, stop the service first
(`systemctl --user stop arbiter.service`), then run the eval.

### Rollback across a migration

`arb server deploy` auto-rolls back to the prior release when the new one
doesn't come back green. **That rollback is refused when the deploy crossed a
migration** — the new release has already applied migrations the prior release
does not ship, and booting the prior release would run old code against a
schema it has never seen. When that happens the deploy:

- leaves `current` pointing at the **new** release,
- prints the names of the crossed migrations, and
- exits non-zero.

Your options, in preference order:

1. **Fix forward** — deploy a newer release (`arb server deploy`). Almost always
   the right move.
2. **Roll the schema back first**, then the code:
   `bin/arbiter eval "Arbiter.Release.rollback(Arbiter.Repo, <version>)"` with
   the service stopped, then
   `arb server deploy --version <prior-tag> --force`.
3. **Accept a mixed-schema rollback** — re-run with
   `--allow-cross-migration-rollback`. This is an explicit data-safety decision:
   the prior release will run against a newer schema. Verify it immediately
   (`arb doctor`, and the pages/flows the new migrations touched).

A deploy that adds no migrations keeps the plain automatic rollback, unchanged.

**"No migrations found" is treated as a broken check, not a safe deploy.** The
comparison reads the new release's `priv/repo/migrations` off disk. An arbiter
release always ships migrations, so an empty result means the release layout
moved and the check is blind. The deploy then refuses the automatic rollback
exactly as if a migration had been crossed (`--json` marks it
`migrations_detected: false`, with an empty `crossed_migrations`), and
`--allow-cross-migration-rollback` is again the explicit override. If you see
this, compare the two releases' migration directories by hand before deciding.

**A refusal after a failed swap is less certain than one after a timeout.** If
`/api/version` still reports the old release, the new one never booted, so its
migrations were probably never applied — the message says so rather than
asserting the schema moved. Check the schema before choosing between fixing
forward and rolling back.

### Data backfills on a release install

A release install (the production path, since 2026-06) has no Mix toolchain,
so `mix arbiter.backfill_*` cannot run there — only `bin/arbiter eval` can.
Every backfill lives in `Arbiter.Release.backfill/2`, starts only Ash + the
repo (never a second endpoint/Autopilot/patrols next to the live server), and
defaults to a dry run. Pass `apply?: true` to write:

    bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.backfill(:codex_usage)'
    bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.backfill(:gemini_usage_note)'
    bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.backfill(:issue_repos)'
    bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.backfill(:run_steps)'
    bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.backfill(:task_statuses, repo_path: "/path/to/arbiter")'

`:task_statuses` reads `git log`, and `:repo_path` defaults to wherever
`bin/arbiter` was invoked from — always pass it explicitly in a release eval.
See the `Arbiter.Release.backfill/2` moduledoc for the full option list per
backfill.

### The first upgrade past v0.1.63 is not protected — snapshot the DB

Everything above describes the **current** deployer. The ordering guarantee
("stop → boot → migrate", and the cross-migration rollback refusal) shipped in
#1653, and it lives in the `arb` CLI, not in the server. A deploy is driven by
the CLI you already have installed — so when you upgrade *from* v0.1.63 or
earlier, the deploy still runs under the **old** ordering, no matter which
release you are deploying:

    migrate  →  swap  →  restart  →  health check  →  roll back on failure

That means a failed health check rolls the *code* back and leaves the *schema*
migrated. The prior release then runs against a newer schema, and
`arb server doctor` will still report `migrations up to date` — Ecto only
checks that the migrations it knows about are present, not that the schema has
nothing extra.

This is exactly what happened on the first v0.1.64 attempt (#1728): the release
could not boot, the deploy auto-rolled back to v0.1.63, and all 20 of
v0.1.64's migrations stayed applied (`schema_migrations` 59 → 79, including the
new `sessions`, `review_coverage`, `provider_accounts` and
`provider_credentials` tables plus their backfills).

So, for that one upgrade only:

1. **Snapshot the SQLite DB first** — with the service stopped, copy
   `~/.arbiter/arbiter.sqlite3*` (including `-wal`/`-shm`) somewhere safe, or
   use `sqlite3 <db> ".backup <path>"`.
2. Deploy. If the health check fails and it rolls back, assume the schema
   moved: either fix forward to a release that boots, or restore the snapshot
   before running the older code for any length of time.
3. From the next upgrade on, the installed CLI has #1653 and the ordering above
   applies.

### Post-deploy: confirm patrols are lazy (bd-7tr11p acceptance gate)

Patrols exist only while a repo has watched work (an open review engagement or a
fleet-authored open PR). A restart with no open work must produce **no** patrol
sweep at all. Verify this after any deploy that touches patrol lifecycle, with
the fleet idle (0 workers, no open engagements, no fleet-authored open PRs):

    scripts/measure_patrol_idle_rate_limit.sh        # samples >=5 min, asserts near-zero

`gh api rate_limit` is exempt, so the sampler doesn't perturb what it measures —
any rise in `.resources.core.used` over the window is background traffic. **Pass**
= near zero. **Fail** = something is still polling; grep the journal for the
per-repo patrol **start**/**stop** lines to see which repo and why. Compare a
fail against the pre-#1036 signature: a ~30-call burst ~1/min (~2,200/hr idle).

This is the live measurement `bd-4brb2j` asked for and could not satisfy; it can
only run against a real deployment, not from a worker worktree. Record the
samples on the PR / task.

## 9. Trust State, But Verify

- A worker can show "running" while its subprocess is dead — check the port or
  log, not just status.
- A PR marked CLEAN/MERGEABLE means no merge conflict, **not** an empty diff.
  Read the real `git diff origin/main...<branch>` before calling work "empty"
  or "failed".
- Close-on-merge can miss on out-of-band merges — close the issue manually if it
  stalls.

## 10. Review Gate

The pre-merge review gate. After the round cap it escalates for **your**
judgment.

Read the full implementer↔reviewer transcript before deciding. Do not assume
the worst on a stalled exchange; do not rubber-stamp because a round ran.
Decide for yourself.

## 11. Watch Efficiently

Use shell-poll monitors that wake only on real state changes. Avoid
fixed-interval wakeups that burn tokens re-reading context on every tick.

## 12. Provider-Agnostic

Never hardcode model names. Route via abstract tiers:

| Tier | Use |
|------|-----|
| economy | Cheap, fast, simple tasks |
| standard | Most issues (default) |
| premium | Hard / correctness-critical work |

Plus thinking budget: `none / low / medium / high`. Resolved per adapter at
dispatch time.

**Verify CLI flags against the installed agent CLI version** — a wrong flag
crashes the worker at launch with no useful error.

## 13. Review Capability

`arb review <id>` reviews the PR/MR linked to an Arbiter task: fetches the diff
and posts findings + verdict. The PR author needs **no** Arbiter setup.

`arb review --pr <url|number> [--repo <checkout>] [--workspace <ref>]` reviews an
**external / non-arbiter PR** — one the fleet never opened (a coworker's PR) —
with no task and no branch. It constructs a merge-request ref through the
workspace's **MR provider** (the `config["merge"]["strategy"]` adapter —
github/gitlab, *not* the issue tracker, so a Jira-tracked workspace still reviews
its GitHub PRs) and runs the CodeReview adapter workflow: read diff → post inline
findings → submit a verdict, all on the PR. `--pr` accepts a forge URL, an
`owner/repo#N` slug, or a bare number (pass `--repo` so a number resolves to
owner/repo via the checkout's `origin` remote). The same is exposed over MCP as
`worker_review` with a `pr` argument.

## 14. Lanes & Merge Posture

Use **separate workspaces** for separate concerns (self-dev vs company repos).

| Lane | `auto_merge` | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Company / shared | OFF | A human merges |
| Self-dev / experimental | ON | Safe to automate |

### Per-repo merge overrides (`merge.repos.<repo>`)

A workspace's `merge.*` settings apply to every repo in its `repo_paths`. One
repo can differ without a workspace of its own: `merge.repos.<repo>` takes any
`merge` key (`strategy`, `config`, `auto_merge`, `base`, `branch_prefix`, …)
and is deep-merged over the workspace block, so whatever it leaves unset falls
back field by field. `<repo>` is the `repo_paths` key. The typical case is a
local infra repo with no git remote in a workspace that merges via GitHub:

```bash
arb config set merge.repos.mesaana.strategy direct
```

Its tasks then merge locally (`git merge --no-ff` in the checkout; with no
`origin` the push is skipped), and it gets no PR patrol, review patrol or
merged-PR finalizer. The other repos keep opening GitHub PRs. The reverse also
works: in a `direct` workspace, set `merge.repos.<repo>.strategy github` plus
`merge.repos.<repo>.config.owner` / `.repo`.

The MCP `workspace_config_get` tool reports each repo's
`effective_merge_strategies`. `arb server doctor`'s **merge routing** check lists
each repo's effective strategy and fails on a repo whose strategy is
github/gitlab but whose checkout has no `origin` remote, or whose `origin` is
not the effective `merge.config` owner/repo. It prints the `arb config set`
that fixes it.

## 15. Legacy terminology reference

Older docs and transcripts use themed names for generic concepts. The mapping,
for reference (these terms are retired; use the current terms listed below):

| Legacy term | Current term |
|-------------|--------------|
| Acolyte / Polecat | Worker |
| Admiral | Coordinator (you) |
| Tribunal | Review gate |
| Warden | Watchdog |
| Refinery | Merge queue |
| Inquisitor | Reviewer |
| Crucible | Review / escalation system |
| Witness | Monitor |
| Rig / Outpost | Repo / worktree |
| Sling | Dispatch |
| Campaign / Strike Force | Batch |
| Fleet | The set of active workers |
| Directive | Task / issue |
| Summons | Work prompt |

## 16. Active Monitoring — Coordinator Inbox

The coordinator inbox is your command center for real-time coordination. Workers
escalate here automatically when they hit blocking decisions; stand a background
poll and check regularly while workers are in flight.

### Polling Command

Check the coordinator inbox with:

```bash
arb message inbox              # check all unread messages
arb message inbox <task-id>   # check messages for a specific task
```

Or use the continuous monitor (recommended while workers are in flight):

```bash
arb notify             # background daemon that alerts on inbox changes
```

**Suggested cadence:** Poll every ~60 seconds while workers are in flight.
This catches review gate escalations and critical failures before they stall work.

### What to Look For

The coordinator inbox surfaces three classes of escalations:

1. **Review Gate Escalations** — A worker's code review hit the round cap and is
   waiting for your judgment. The review gate has flagged it as needing
   coordinator ruling to unblock. **These are decision gates — read them and rule.**

2. **Auth Failures** — A worker could not authenticate to a remote system
   (tracker API, GitHub, etc.). **These require credential fixes or permission
   corrections at the coordinator level.**

3. **Worker Crashes** — A worker encountered an unrecoverable error and
   terminated. **Check the logs and retry or escalate.**

Use `arb show <task-id>` to see the full transcript and context for any message.

### Responding to a Review Gate Escalation

When the inbox surfaces a review gate escalation:

1. **Read the full transcript:**
   ```bash
   arb show <task-id>   # see the complete exchange
   ```

2. **Send your ruling to the worker:**
   ```bash
   arb message <task-id> "Your ruling here: approve / reject / clarify and retry"
   ```

3. **Resume the worker to continue:**
   ```bash
   arb resume <task-id> <repo>   # worker picks up from where it left off
   ```

The worker will see your message, incorporate your judgment, and continue the
work (or stop if you rejected).

### Worker Status Sweep

While polling is happening, periodically sweep all workers for failures that
may not yet be in the inbox:

```bash
arb worker list        # list all active and recently-completed workers
```

Each run is labelled in the run vocabulary — its kind (`implement`, `review`,
`fix_pass`, `conflict`) and its state (`starting`, `working`, `waiting`,
`finished` with an outcome). A run never describes its ticket: read the ticket's
column and attention for that. Look for:
- **finished (failed)** / **finished (interrupted)** — A run stopped without
  succeeding. With nothing else live on the ticket, the ticket carries
  `run_crashed` attention and shows in `arb prime`'s Needs attention. Check
  `arb issue show <task-id>` for the reason and resume or close.
- **waiting** — On a question (answer it; the ticket carries
  `run_asked_question` attention) or on the review gate (the machine's turn).
- **starting** / **working** — Expected; the run is working.
- **finished (succeeded)** — The attempt is done; the ticket has moved on
  (Merging, Verifying or Closed).

Catch failures early — don't wait for them to be reported upstream.

## 17. Loop analysis (weekly)

Periodically review how the loop itself is performing:

    arb loop analyze --since 7d          # or: mix arbiter.loop.analyze --since 7d

This is the **manual, read-only** Stage 1 loop-analysis pass. It segments
failures operational-vs-agent-quality by allowlist (so our own deploy restarts
don't dominate), corroborates each `failure_reason` against the transcript
(the label lies — context-exhaustion hides behind "rate-limited"/"crashed"
labels), and emits a report with a suggested destination per finding (skill /
repo `CLAUDE.md` / per-task override). It **writes nothing** but the report and
one cost-ledger row — you read it and decide. Evidence bar for any fleet-wide
change: ≥ 3 incidents across ≥ 2 tasks; a single incident is a per-task
override. Full guide: `docs/loop-review.md`.

## 18. Run archives & retention

Each finished run leaves its artifacts in the durable log root
(`~/dev/arbiter-worker-logs` by default), all keyed by `run_id`:

    <run_id>.log          rendered transcript
    <run_id>.prompt       composed prompt
    <run_id>.jsonl.gz     the agent CLI's own session JSONL (gzipped, redacted)
    <run_id>.subagents/   subagent transcripts, same treatment

The `.jsonl.gz` is the only full-fidelity record — untruncated tool inputs and
results, thinking blocks, per-message token usage and model lineage. Everything
else is a rendering.

**Claude Code prunes its session store at ~21 days**, so that artifact expires
unless Arbiter copies it. Gemini and Codex were not observed pruning. Live runs
archive themselves; rescue pre-existing ones with
`mix arbiter.archive_sessions --apply` (dry-run by default, idempotent).
Monitor coverage with the `transcript_capture_stats` MCP tool, which reports
the rendered log and the JSONL archive as **separate** rates.

**The log root is secret-bearing.** Archives are redacted on ingest through
`Arbiter.Redaction`, but redaction only knows secrets someone marked — it
cannot catch a key a subprocess happened to print. Archives are written `0600`
and the root `0700`. Don't sync it to shared storage or back it up with weaker
access control than the host account. Full guide: `docs/session-archive.md`.

## 19. Reading the usage ledger — not all spend is a task

`usage_events` records every model round-trip Arbiter dispatches. Until
bd-adyhvn it could only attribute spend to a **task**: `task_id` was `NOT NULL`,
so the two largest task-less spenders wrote nothing at all.

Every row now carries a `source` discriminator:

| source | `task_id` | who writes it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `task` | always set | `Arbiter.Worker` / `Dispatch` — real worker sessions |
| `probe` | never set | **historical only** — `Arbiter.Quota.RefreshProbe` was deleted in bd-atyrrq; no longer written |
| `preflight` | set when a task is being gated | `Arbiter.Agents.Preflight` — the auth check before every dispatch and resume |
| `coordinator_session` | never set | a browser-hosted coordinator session |
| `terminal_session` | never set | an interactive terminal session |
| `maintenance` | never set | scheduled internal passes (e.g. `arb loop analyze`) |

Start a spend review with the split, not the task list:

    arb usage --by source --since 7d      # the whole bill
    arb usage --by task   --since 7d      # the task-attributed part of it
    arb usage events --source probe --since 24h

`--by task` deliberately **drops** task-less rows rather than bucketing them
under a placeholder, so it shows no phantom or sentinel ids. Every other
grouping (`--by day`, `--by source`, `--by workspace`, `--by provider`,
`--by model`) counts all rows, so nothing is lost — the two views just answer
different questions. `--by task` still totals less than `--by day`; that gap is
the task-less spend, and it is real.

### Measurement consequence — older figures understate consumption

Any figure derived from ledger spend **before** this change understates real
consumption, because the probe and pre-flight draws were invisible to it. Before
the probe was deleted in bd-atyrrq, measured figures were:

  * `RefreshProbe` — **historical only**: 243 calls/day at ~57K mean cache-read tokens ≈ **$3.08/day** (deleted; no longer draws any quota)
  * pre-flight auth check — 322 calls/day at ~39K mean tokens ≈ **$2.05/day**

That is ~565 calls/day, ~$5/day, that no ledger-derived number included. A
one-word prompt is not a cheap call: the CLI still ships its whole system
prompt and tool definitions on every round-trip, which is where the cache-read
tokens come from.

Sizing the whole gap, measured over one Max 5x weekly window (2026-09-07 16:00Z
→ 2026-09-12 01:35Z, which reached 96%):

| component | spend | in the ledger? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| workers | $825.21 | yes, before this change |
| coordinator session | $209.64 | **no — needs bd-cyxzvq** |
| `RefreshProbe` (deleted) | $13.55 | **historical only** |
| pre-flight auth check | $9.02 | yes, after this change |
| **total** | **$1,057.42** | |

`RefreshProbe`'s row is historical: it was deleted in bd-atyrrq. The probe no
longer runs and no longer spends any quota — its $3.08/day and $13.55 figures
are frozen artifacts of the window they were measured in, not an ongoing cost.

The worker-only ledger implied **$8.60 per 1%** of the weekly window; the true
figure was **$11.01 per 1%** — a 28% understatement. Read that table carefully
before re-baselining: this change closes $22.57 of the $232.21 gap, so the
per-1% figure moves to about **$8.83**. The single largest missing component is
the coordinator's own session, which this schema can now represent
(`source: coordinator_session`, keyed by `session_id`) but which nothing writes
yet. Until bd-cyxzvq lands, a ledger-derived total is still low — by much less
than before, but not by zero.

When you compare a window that straddles the change, expect an apparent
step-up in total spend that is **measurement, not behaviour**. Any quota
baseline captured before 2026-09-12 is low by roughly the figures above, and
scarcity and utilization estimates derived from one were biased in the same
direction. Re-baseline from ledger data
after this change rather than adjusting old numbers by hand.
