  # ONE PLT for the whole umbrella.
  #
  # dialyxir defaults `plt_core_path`/`plt_local_path` to the *current*
  # project's build directory. In an umbrella that means `mix dialyzer` run
  # from apps/arbiter, apps/arbiter_web and apps/arbiter_cli would each build
  # and maintain a separate copy of the same multi-minute PLT — three PLTs
  # covering an almost identical dependency tree, none of them reused. Pinning
  # both paths to a single umbrella-root directory (each child app points at
  # `../../priv/plts`) makes the first build pay the cost once and every
  # subsequent run — from the root or from any child app — reuse it.
  #
  # The canonical invocation is `mix dialyzer` from the umbrella root:
  # dialyxir walks every child app's ebin, so one run covers all three.
  # Running it from inside a child app works and reuses the same PLT
  # (dialyxir even refuses to build one there — "In an Umbrella child, not
  # checking PLT..."), but it only analyses that app, so the other apps'
  # entries in .dialyzer_ignore.exs match nothing and `list_unused_filters`
  # reports them as unnecessary skips. That is an artifact of the narrower
  # scope, not a stale baseline — `mix audit` and CI both run from the root.
