# Dialyzer warning filters for the whole umbrella (see `dialyzer/0` in
# mix.exs, which points every app here).
#
# `list_unused_filters: true` is set alongside it, so a filter that stops
# matching FAILS the run rather than lingering. That is deliberate: a
# suppression file nobody prunes is how a real warning eventually gets
# masked by a stale entry someone added for an unrelated reason.
#
# Entries may be:
#
#     {"lib/arbiter/some_module.ex"}                      # whole file
#     {"lib/arbiter/some_module.ex", :unknown_function}   # file + warning type
#     {"lib/arbiter/some_module.ex", :call, 42}           # file + type + line
#     ~r/regex against the formatted warning/
#
# Add one only with a comment saying which warning it silences and why the
# code is correct as written.
#
# ── Why these are {file, type} pairs and not {file, type, line} ────────────
#
# Line-pinned filters would be tighter, but every entry below sits in a file
# that fleet workers edit constantly (worker.ex is ~4.5k lines, dispatch.ex
# ~2.2k). A line-pinned baseline turns any insertion above a filtered site
# into an "Unnecessary Skip" and fails CI on a PR that changed nothing
# related. File+type keeps the baseline stable under line drift while still
# failing on a NEW warning class in the same file — the trade the credo
# baseline in this branch made too (per-site `disable-for-next-line`, but
# thresholds left at the tool's own defaults).
#
# Everything here was triaged individually during bd-4x2yhq's first pass.
# The genuine bugs that pass turned up were FIXED, not filtered — see the
# preceding commits: two closed map specs (CoordinatorNotifier.snapshot/0,
# MCP.Scope.mint_worker/3), Watchdog.parked_on/1's missing
# `:ci_failed_external`, Quota.Overage.windowed_spend/2's over-narrow
# params, Tasks.Claim.claim_result's missing tuple errors, and a bogus
# `allow_nonexistent_atoms?` option that typed ArbiterCli.Output.
# extract_mode/1 as `none()`. That is 33 of the original 94 warnings.

  # ── 1. Defensive catch-all clauses (`pattern_match_cov`) ──────────────────
  #
  # `_other -> ...` / `_ -> ...` fallbacks placed after clauses that, for the
  # types dialyzer can currently see, already cover the domain. They are not
  # dead code in any meaningful sense: the values reaching them come from
  # tracker/merger JSON, agent stdout, Ash resources and LiveView assigns,
  # i.e. from outside the analysed boundary, where a shape dialyzer proved
  # impossible today becomes possible the moment an upstream API adds an enum
  # value. Deleting the clause converts that into a FunctionClauseError inside
  # a GenServer — for the Watchdog and the patrols, a crash loop on live
  # workers. The clause stays; the warning does not.

  # ── 2. Defensive error branches (`pattern_match`) ─────────────────────────
  #
  # `{:error, reason} -> ...` (or a narrower error atom) after a callee whose
  # success typing has only the happy arm today. Same reasoning as group 1,
  # with one addition specific to the controllers: dropping the branch means
  # an unexpected error propagates as a 500 instead of the mapped 4xx, and
  # `Autopilot.pause/0` / `resume/0` are GenServer calls whose contract is a
  # one-line change away from gaining an error arm.
  #
  #   * agents/preflight.ex — not a defensive clause at all: dialyzer
  #     resolves a build-time `function_exported?/3` check against a module
  #     it has already analysed to a constant and calls the other branch of
  #     the `if` dead. `arbiter_cli/version.ex` has the same shape (`if
  #     @git_dirty`, baked in by `git status --porcelain` at compile time)
  #     but isn't filtered here: CI always builds from a clean checkout, so
  #     `@git_dirty` is `false` there and the warning never fires — a filter
  #     for it would sit unused and fail `list_unused_filters`. It only
  #     appears on a dev machine with a dirty tree.
  #   * worker/review_gate.ex — a bare `:no_verdict` atom clause beside the
  #     `{:no_verdict, reason}` tuple one. Cheap total-function hygiene on a
  #     private helper.
  #   * arbiter_cli/version.ex / cmd/doctor/checks.ex — the same
  #     compile-time-constant shape as the `@git_dirty` case above, for
  #     `@git_available` (`dev_build?/0`). A prior pass here assumed this
  #     bakes to `true` in CI (git present, no `RELEASE_VERSION`) and added
  #     filters for it, but `actions/checkout@v4`'s default `fetch-depth: 1`
  #     means CI's clone has no tags, so `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`
  #     fails and `@git_available` folds to `false` there instead — same as
  #     `@git_dirty`, the warning never fires in CI and a filter for it sits
  #     unused. No entry needed for either module.

  # ── 3. Defensive nil / type guards (`guard_fail`, `neg_guard_fail`) ───────
  #
  # `when x === nil`, `when not is_binary(x)`, `when is_integer(id)` on a
  # value every current caller supplies non-nil and of one type. These are
  # the guard-clause form of group 1 and protect the same boundaries:
  #
  #   * trackers/gitlab.ex — `resolve_user_id/2`'s documented "or a numeric
  #     id, passed through" clause. Every caller happens to hold a binary
  #     today; the pass-through is part of the helper's contract.
  #   * worker.ex, worker/dispatch.ex — nil-checks on `meta` maps and branch
  #     names that Ash and the mergers type as non-nil but that arrive from
  #     persisted task rows, where a NULL column is one migration away.
  #   * loop/analysis.ex — the same shape on a report map.
  #
  #   `arbiter_cli/cmd/doctor/checks.ex`'s `if dev_install?() do` is
  #   downstream of the same `ArbiterCli.Version.dev_build?/0` constant noted
  #   in group 2 — no filter here either, for the same reason.

  # ── 4. MapSet opaqueness (`contract_with_opaque`, `call_without_opaque`) ──
  #
  # A long-standing dialyzer limitation, not a defect in this code. `MapSet.t`
  # is opaque, but dialyzer sees through to the concrete `{:set, ...}` /
  # `%{_ => []}` internal representation whenever it can constant-fold a
  # `MapSet.new/0,1` in the same analysis pass. It then reports the resulting
  # concrete type as "violating" the very opaque type it just unwrapped. Every
  # site here builds a MapSet and passes it straight to another MapSet
  # function — `MapSet.union/2`, `MapSet.disjoint?/2` — which is exactly the
  # supported use.

  # ── 5. `pattern_match` fallout from the `:exact_compare` fixes ────────────
  #
  # OTP 28 added an `:exact_compare` warning class that dialyxir 1.4.7 can
  # neither format ("Unknown warning: :exact_compare / Please file a bug") nor
  # filter — `Dialyxir.Formatter.filter_warning/3` only consults the ignore
  # file for warning types it knows, so no entry here can silence one. The
  # site was therefore rewritten in source rather than suppressed
  # (pr_patrol.ex `meta: nil` in the clause head), moving the nil check into
  # a clause the analysed types say is unreachable, i.e. group 1 again.
