defmodule Mix.Tasks.Arbiter.Accounts.Migrate do
  @shortdoc "Apply an operator-edited provider-account plan (P2 extraction)"

  @moduledoc """
  Phase P2 of the provider-accounts migration (`docs/provider-account-design.md`
  §7.2–§7.5). Applies the plan `mix arbiter.accounts.census` proposed and the
  operator edited:

    1. creates the `provider_accounts` / `provider_credentials` /
       `workspace_provider_accounts` rows the plan describes;
    2. writes a Vault-encrypted `provider_account_migration_backups` row per
       affected workspace **before** touching it (§7.5);
    3. removes only the §7.3-allowlisted keys from that workspace's
       `worker_env`, via the existing `MergeWorkerEnv` change.

  Every check runs before the first write, so a refusal leaves the database and
  the plan file exactly as it found them. The task prints counts, workspace
  names and env var names — never a value (§7.4).

  ## Before you run this (§7.6)

  `ARBITER_CLOAK_KEY` should already have been rotated **and the provider
  credential itself re-issued**. Otherwise this writes fresh ciphertext under a
  key considered exposed, and the rotation sweep then has to cover the new
  tables too.

  ## Turning the new tables on (§7.5's "Release N+1")

  Moving a key out of the blob stops a worker spawned from that workspace
  receiving it from the blob. Since P3 (bd-aiodva) the account row supplies it
  instead, and since the P13 flip (bd-9gqj8e) the account is the only source
  there is. The backup rows this writes are the migration record
  `Arbiter.Accounts.Enablement` looks for. So the order is: migrate every
  workspace that carries a provider credential, then restart.

  A workspace whose blob still carries a credential that no account supplies
  raises `Arbiter.Accounts.MissingCredentialError` at spawn time rather than
  dispatching a worker with no credential. `mix arbiter.accounts.rollback`
  undoes a migration (the backup row is written for exactly this), which
  puts the key back in the blob — and so leaves the workspace unable to
  spawn until it is migrated again.

  ## Usage

      mix arbiter.accounts.migrate --plan accounts.json
      mix arbiter.accounts.migrate --plan accounts.json --dry-run
      mix arbiter.accounts.migrate --plan accounts.json --delete-plan

  ## Options

    * `--plan PATH` — **required.** The edited plan file.
    * `--dry-run` — validate and report what would happen; write nothing.
    * `--delete-plan` — delete the plan file after a successful apply. §7.4
      suggests it; it is opt-in here rather than the default, because the file
      is the operator's own edited artefact and it contains no secret (only
      fingerprints and key names), so destroying it unasked buys nothing.

  ## Release installs

  A thin wrapper over `Arbiter.Release.accounts_migrate/1`, which a release
  install (no Mix toolchain) runs directly:

      bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.accounts_migrate(plan: "/home/me/.arbiter/accounts.json", dry_run?: true)'
      bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.accounts_migrate(plan: "/home/me/.arbiter/accounts.json")'

  See `docs/provider-accounts-release-runbook.md` for the full procedure,
  including setting the flag.
