defmodule Mix.Tasks.Arbiter.BackfillTaskStatuses do
  @shortdoc "Close tasks that have feat() commits on main but are not yet :closed"
  @moduledoc """
  Walk `git log` for `feat(<task-id>)` commits on a branch and close any
  matching tasks whose lifecycle `state` is not yet `:closed`.

  This is a recovery tool for the task-status drift the cutover postmortem
  documented: the original Dolt source-of-truth fell behind during
  late-Phase implementation, and the importer carried stale open
  statuses forward into Postgres.

  ## Usage

      mix arbiter.backfill_task_statuses              # dry-run (prints proposals)
      mix arbiter.backfill_task_statuses --apply      # actually close tasks
      mix arbiter.backfill_task_statuses --branch dev # use a different branch

  ## What you see in dry-run

  A list of tasks that would be closed, with the commit SHA and subject
  that justified each closure. No writes happen. Review the list, then
  re-run with `--apply` to commit the changes.

  ## Release installs

  This is a thin CLI wrapper over `Arbiter.Release.backfill/2`, which is
  Mix-free and callable from a release install with no Elixir toolchain:

      bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.backfill(:task_statuses)'             # dry-run
      bin/arbiter eval 'Arbiter.Release.backfill(:task_statuses, apply?: true)'

  It starts only Ash + the Ecto repo, never the full app-boot task ("app.start"):
  booting the full application next to a live coordinator would start a
  second endpoint on the same port, a second Autopilot and a second set of
  patrols against the same database.
