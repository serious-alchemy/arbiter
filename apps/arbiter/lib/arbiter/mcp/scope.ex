defmodule Arbiter.MCP.Scope do
  @moduledoc """
  The capability model for an `Arbiter.MCP` connection — and its single
  enforcement point.

  Capability is a pure function of the bearer token presented on the MCP
  connection, not a code fork. The token is a signed, expiring blob
  (`Arbiter.MCP.mint/2` / `verify/2`) carrying the claims below; this module
  mints those tokens per spawn, decodes a presented token back into a `%Scope{}`,
  and answers the capability questions the transport and tool handlers ask
  (`from_token/1`, `own_task/2`, `same_workspace?/2`).

  ## Tiers

      %Arbiter.MCP.Scope{
        tier:         :worker | :coordinator | :refine,
        workspace_id: "uuid" | nil,    # worker/refine: the bound workspace; coordinator: nil (workspace-agnostic)
        task_id:      "bd-…" | nil,    # worker tier: the one task it may read/progress
        issue_id:     "bd-…" | nil,    # refine tier: the bound issue whose subtree it may write
        repo:         "shipyard" | nil,# worker tier: its repo
        session_id:   "uuid" | nil,    # browser-hosted session this token belongs to (revocable)
        can_dispatch:    false | true,    # coordinator-only; the recursion guardrail
        operator:     false | true,    # coordinator-only; minted over the operator socket (operator proof)
        depth:        0                # dispatch-recursion depth (Phase 2 guardrail)
      }

  | Tier | Reads | Writes | Dispatch |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `:worker` | its own task, its mailbox, its workspace config | progress/qa/deployment notes on **its own task**; flags to siblings | never |
  | `:coordinator` | across any workspace on the installation | create/update/close tasks, deps (incl. `parent_of` grouping); dispatch | yes |
  | `:refine` | broadly across its **bound workspace** (tasks, graph reads, repos, skills, workspace config) | title/description/acceptance/typing/notes edits, `ticket_create`, dep edges and `ticket_promote` — **only inside the bound issue's `parent_of` subtree** | never |

  ## The `:refine` tier (bd-3uy2hn)

  A refine token is the capability behind a browser-hosted *refinement* session:
  it exists to turn one rough Backlog issue into a properly specified, broken-down
  and promotable one, and nothing else.

    * It is bound to a **workspace and an issue**, and carries a `session_id`, so
      it is revocable exactly like a phase-3 session token.
    * **Reads are broad on purpose** — refining an issue means reading its
      neighbours — but every **write** must land on the bound issue or a
      descendant reachable from it by `parent_of` (`subtree_member?/2`).
    * `can_dispatch` is **always** false, whatever the claim says. The tier, not
      the claim, decides: a refine session must never start work, only shape it.

  Which tools a refine token may call at all is one explicit table,
  `Arbiter.MCP.RefinePolicy` — allow or deny for *every* tool in the catalog,
  with no implicit default, so a newly added tool cannot silently inherit
  authority.

  The `:worker` tier is deliberately narrow — it must not list arbitrary tasks,
  dispatch, or touch another task's state, and it is **workspace-scoped**: a worker
  token carries the workspace it was dispatched into and can never reach another.
  Tier-level tool visibility is declared in `Arbiter.MCP.Catalog`; the data-level
  checks (own-task, workspace isolation) live here so handlers cannot accidentally
  skip them.

  ## Workspace-agnostic coordinators

  A coordinator token is **not** bound to a workspace at mint time (its
  `workspace_id` is `nil`): a single coordinator token orchestrates across every
  workspace on the installation. Coordinator-facing tools resolve the target
  workspace per call (explicit `workspace` arg → the referenced entity's own
  workspace → the installation default). Legacy workspace-bound coordinator
  tokens (minted with an explicit workspace before this change) still decode and
  stay scoped to that one workspace — `same_workspace?/2` honors both shapes.

  Mint the `:coordinator`-tier token for one browser-hosted session
  (RFC §9.3, bd-aprlbb).

  Differs from `mint_coordinator/2` in exactly three ways, all of them
  deliberate:

    * It carries a `session_id` claim, which makes the token **revocable**.
      Scope tokens are stateless signed blobs with no revocation table
      (`Arbiter.MCP`'s incident-response note), so the session row is the
      handle: `from_token/1` refuses a token whose session has been ended,
      killed, or explicitly revoked. That is what lets "killing a session
      revokes its token" be true without rotating `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and
      invalidating every other token on the installation.
    * `can_dispatch` defaults **off** (§10.1: dispatch recursion is the
      documented guardrail and switching it on is a deliberate pre-launch
      choice), where `mint_coordinator/2` defaults it on.
    * `workspace_id` is `nil` for the cross-workspace default (decision 6) and
      bound for the opt-in single-workspace binding — the same two shapes
      `same_workspace?/2` already models.

  `session_id` makes it revocable the moment the session ends (see
