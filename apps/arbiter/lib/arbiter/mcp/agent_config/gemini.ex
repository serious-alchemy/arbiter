defmodule Arbiter.MCP.AgentConfig.Gemini do
  @moduledoc """
  The `Arbiter.MCP.AgentConfig` adapter for the Gemini *provider* — which is two
  different CLIs with two different, mutually-unreadable config formats:

  | CLI                     | reads                                          | per-spawn config? |
  | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
  | upstream `gemini`       | `<worktree>/.gemini/settings.json`              | yes               |
  | `agy` (Antigravity)     | `$HOME/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`          | via a per-spawn `$HOME` |

  `Arbiter.Agents.Gemini.resolve_executable/0` prefers `agy` over `gemini` when
  both are on `PATH`, so on an Antigravity host the provider is *agy*, and
  writing `.gemini/settings.json` is writing a file nothing will ever read. This
  module therefore routes on the CLI flavour (`cli_flavour/1`) and, for agy,
  writes into the spawn's isolated `$HOME` instead of the worktree (bd-m8geh4,
  bd-7s29yq).

  ## What agy actually reads (verified live, agy v1.2.5, 2026-09-17)

  agy's own embedded docs (`# MCP Servers (mcp_config.json)`, extractable with
  `strings -n 6 $(which agy) | grep -n 'Configuration File'`) enumerate exactly
  two locations:

    * **Global**: `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`
    * **Plugin**: `plugins/<plugin_name>/mcp_config.json`, inside a
      *customization root*

  and its plugin docs name `.agents/plugins/` as an example customization root.
  That reads like a worktree-local hook, so it was probed end-to-end rather than
  assumed. It is not one — in `--print` (headless) mode, which is the only mode
  Arbiter ever runs, agy performs **no workspace customization discovery at
  all**.

  ### Probe (reproducible; ~4 agy turns)

      # 1. a local MCP endpoint that logs every request it receives
      PROBE=$(mktemp -d); cd "$PROBE"; git init -q .
      python3 -m http.server --bind 127.0.0.1 47821 &   # or any request logger

      # 2. the candidate worktree-local path, with the manifest agy documents
      mkdir -p .agents/plugins/arbiter
      echo '{"name":"arbiter"}' > .agents/plugins/arbiter/plugin.json
      cat > .agents/plugins/arbiter/mcp_config.json <<'JSON'
      {"mcpServers":{"arbiter":{"serverUrl":"http://127.0.0.1:47821/mcp",
        "headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer probe"},"enabledTools":["probe_ping"]}}}
      JSON

      # 3. run agy from that cwd and watch the endpoint
      agy -p "Call the probe_ping tool if you have it." --output-format text

  Results:

    * `.agents/plugins/arbiter/mcp_config.json` (+ `plugin.json`) — **zero**
      requests reached the endpoint; agy reported no such tool.
    * adding an `.agents/plugins.json` manifest (`{"entries":[{"path":
      ".agents/plugins"}]}`), the documented explicit-registration escape
      hatch — still **zero** requests.
    * control: the *same* plugin directory placed at
      `~/.gemini/config/plugins/<name>/` — full handshake
      (`server/discover` → `initialize` → `notifications/initialized` →
      `tools/list`) with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request.
    * a second control ruled out folder trust and workspace discovery
      generally: a worktree-local `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` was likewise
      invisible to `agy -p`, with the worktree marked `TRUST_FOLDER` in
      `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json`.

  `agy mcp list` / `agy plugin list` are **not** valid probes: they only report
  the user-level `mcp_config.json` and explicitly imported plugins, so both
  print "none" even while a global plugin server is connecting fine.

  There is also no config-dir environment variable to relocate per spawn — agy
  derives `~/.gemini` from `HOME` and exposes no `AGY_*`/`GEMINI_*` override
  (`strings $(which agy) | grep -oE '(AGY|GEMINI)_[A-Z0-9_]+'`). Per-spawn
  isolation therefore needs a per-worker `HOME`.

  ## Consequence (updated by bd-7s29yq / T6b)

  `Arbiter.Agents.Gemini.ConfigDir` now gives every agy spawn its own `$HOME`,
  keyed on the worktree, so the global-only location finally *is* per-spawn:
  `write_mcp_config/2` writes `agy_config_map/1`'s output to
  `<isolated-home>/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` and the worktree stays empty.

  The refusal path is kept for the one case where it is still right: with
  worker config isolation switched off there is no Arbiter-owned `$HOME`, and
  the only remaining location is the operator's own
  `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` — which a per-task scope token must never
  be written into. `{:error, :unsupported}` then flows on to
  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch`, which logs it at `:error` so the capability
  downgrade is visible rather than silent.

  ## The two schemas

  Upstream `gemini` (`<worktree>/.gemini/settings.json`) — `httpUrl`,
  `includeTools`:

      {"mcpServers": {"arbiter": {
        "httpUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4848/mcp",
        "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer <scope-token>"},
        "includeTools": ["ticket_show", ...]}}}

  `agy` (`mcp_config.json`) — `serverUrl`, `enabledTools`:

      {"mcpServers": {"arbiter": {
        "serverUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4848/mcp",
        "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer <scope-token>"},
        "enabledTools": ["ticket_show", ...]}}}

  Both keys were confirmed live: agy connects on `serverUrl` and sends the
  `headers` verbatim, and `enabledTools` really filters — a server advertising
  `probe_ping` and `probe_hidden` with `"enabledTools": ["probe_ping"]` left agy
  seeing only `probe_ping`.

  The tool allowlist is a *secondary* scope hook in either CLI — the server
  enforces the worker's capability via the signed token; the client-side list
  just keeps the agent's tool menu to what the token permits, so
  most-restrictive-wins. Coordinator-scope callers may pass `include_tools: nil`
  to omit it.

  Write the Gemini-family MCP config into `worktree`.

  Routes on `cli_flavour/1`:

    * `:gemini` — writes `.gemini/settings.json`, the upstream CLI's
      project-scoped settings file.
    * `:agy` — writes `mcp_config.json` into the spawn's **isolated `$HOME`**
      (`Arbiter.Agents.Gemini.ConfigDir`, keyed on the same `worktree`), which
      is the only path agy reads MCP servers from. Nothing is written into the
      worktree itself — agy would never read it. When worker config isolation
      is switched off there is no Arbiter-owned `$HOME` to write into, and this
      still returns `{:error, :unsupported}`: dropping a per-task scope token
      into the operator's own `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` is never
      acceptable, and the loud refusal keeps the capability downgrade visible
      at dispatch (bd-7s29yq).
