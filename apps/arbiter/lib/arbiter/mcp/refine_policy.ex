defmodule Arbiter.MCP.RefinePolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  The tool-level allow/deny table for the `:refine` scope tier (bd-3uy2hn).

  ## Why a table and not a `:tiers` entry

  Every other tier declares its tools inline, in each `Arbiter.MCP.Catalog` entry's
  `:tiers` list. The refine tier does not, for one reason: **a tool added to the
  catalog with no `:refine` in its `:tiers` is silently denied, and a tool added
  with one is silently allowed — either way, nobody had to decide.** For a tier
  whose whole purpose is to hand a browser session a narrow slice of the
  coordinator's authority, "nobody decided" is the failure mode that matters.

  So the decision lives here, once, for every tool, and
  `Arbiter.MCP.RefinePolicyTest` fails the build when a catalog tool has no entry.
  Adding an MCP tool now forces an explicit answer to "may a refine session call
  this?".

  ## The permission set

  **Reads are broad.** Refining an issue means reading its neighbours — the epic
  above it, the sibling that already solved half the problem, the repo it belongs
  to, the skills a worker would bring. The task- and workspace-shaped
  reads resolve their target through `Arbiter.MCP.Tools.authorized_workspace/2` /
  `Arbiter.MCP.Tools.resolve_workspace_id/2`, which pin a workspace-bound scope to
  its own workspace, so breadth there costs nothing across workspaces.

  `repo_list` / `repo_show` are the deliberate exception: repos are an
  installation-level registry, not a per-workspace one, and those two handlers
  ignore the scope and return the installation-wide list. That is intended — a
  refine session needs to name the repo a task belongs to — and it is a read of
  configuration, not of anyone's work.

  **Writes are narrow, and doubly gated.** A tool being allowed here only means a
  refine session may *call* it; the handler then requires the target to be the
  bound issue or a `parent_of` descendant of it
  (`Arbiter.MCP.Tools.authorize_subtree/2`). Allowing `task_update` does not allow
  updating any task — it allows updating a task in the subtree.

  **Nothing that starts, stops, or closes work.** No dispatch (`can_dispatch` is
  hard-wired false on the tier), no `task_demote`/`task_close`/`task_reopen`/`task_verify`, no
  `task_rank`, no scheduler or circuit-breaker controls, no installation or
  workspace config writes, no skill writes, no outbound mail. A refine session
  shapes a backlog item and promotes it; the board decides what happens next.
