  # ---- task_create --------------------------------------------------------

  @doc """
  Create a task in a workspace. The target workspace is resolved from the optional
  `workspace` arg (name or id), else the scope's bound workspace, else the
  installation default — and `workspace_id` is then forced onto the task. Backs
  onto `Ash.create(Issue, …)` (the same path `arb create` / the REST
  `POST /api/issues` take), so a workspace with a tracker configured still mirrors
  the new task upstream.

  An optional `parent_id` attaches the new task as a `parent_of` child of an
  existing task in the same workspace, in one call. It is also handed to
  `Issue.create`, so a child of a tracker-linked parent defaults from the
  parent's ticket per `tracker.child_policy` instead of minting its own (#1973);
  a refine session's children are always context-only.

  For a `:refine` scope (bd-3uy2hn) the parent is not optional: it defaults to the
  bound issue and must be the bound issue or one of its descendants, so a refine
  token cannot file a task outside its subtree. The parent is authorized *before*
  the task is created — a refused create leaves nothing behind. The same
  `refine_field_gate/2` that narrows `task_update` also runs here, so a refine
  session cannot set on create (`tracker_ref`, `target_branch`, …)
  what it would be refused on update.

  Attach `issue` under `parent_id` with a `parent_of` edge.

  The edge is a second write, after `Ash.create(Issue, …)` and outside its
  transaction, so it can fail on its own — a parent deleted between the
  authorization and this call, or a resource-level rejection. When it does, the
  task is **kept**, and the error says so. That is deliberate, not an oversight:

    * An issue cannot be un-created. `Ash.destroy` on a task whose paper-trail
      version row already exists fails the version table's foreign key, so there
      is no compensating delete to run.
    * Rolling the pair back in one `Ash.transaction/2` is not available either:
      `Dependencies.add/4` opens its own, and under the test sandbox (and any
      caller already inside a transaction) `Ash.rollback/2` would abort the
      enclosing transaction rather than just this create.

  So the contract is: *the task exists, the edge does not.* For a coordinator
  that is a one-call fix (`dep_add`). For a refine session it is not — the
  unparented task sits outside the bound subtree, and a `parent_of` add needs
  both endpoints inside it (`Tools.authorize_subtree_edge/4`) — so the message
  names the id and says who can re-attach it. Either way nothing is silently
  half-done.

  Public (rather than private) so that contract is directly testable; the
  failure is otherwise only reachable by a race.
