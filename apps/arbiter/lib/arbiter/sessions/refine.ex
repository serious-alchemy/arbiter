defmodule Arbiter.Sessions.Refine do
  @moduledoc """
  The **Refine** entry point: launch (or reopen) *the* agent session bound to
  one Backlog issue (bd-1lszsc, child 3 of epic bd-cksar2).

  An unrefined issue is a sentence someone typed. Turning it into something a
  worker can be dispatched at — a real description, acceptance criteria that
  can be checked, a difficulty, the children it should be split into, the
  edges that order them — is a conversation, and this is where that
  conversation gets an agent. `open/2` is the one door: the issue detail page's
  Refine button and the board card's both call it, and so would anything else
  that wants one.

  ## One live session per issue

  Two things hold that rule, at two different distances from the operator:

    1. `live_session/1` — the fast path. A second click finds the session the
       first one launched and reopens it in the dock.
    2. `sessions_live_issue_binding_index` — a partial unique index on
       `sessions.issue_id WHERE status != 'ended'`. A *concurrent* double
       click, where both requests read "no session" before either writes one,
       loses the race at the database instead. The loser re-reads and returns
       the winner's session, so both clicks still end up in the same place.

  Ending a session drops its row out of that index, which is what makes a
  killed refine session re-openable rather than a permanent lockout.

  ## What the session gets, and why

    * **A `:refine`-tier MCP token, bound to this issue and workspace** (child 1,
      bd-3uy2hn). Not a decision made here — `Arbiter.Sessions.Provisioning.mint_token/2`
      takes it from the row's `issue_id`, so the binding and the token cannot
      drift apart. A refine token can read broadly, write only inside the bound
      issue's `parent_of` subtree, and never dispatch.
    * **Child 2's refine instructions** (bd-980x89), rendered into the session's
      cwd as `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` with this issue, its epic, its edges,
      its workspace and its checkout path filled in.
    * **A read-only checkout of the issue's repo**
      (`Arbiter.Sessions.RepoCheckout`) — for grep and read grounding, nothing
      else. An issue with no repo, or a repo this workspace never registered,
      simply gets no checkout and instructions that say so.

  ## Premium tier, never flagship, thinking `high`

  The model is pinned here rather than routed. `Arbiter.Agents.Routing` exists
  to price *dispatched work* by difficulty, and a refine session has no
  difficulty — the whole point of the conversation is to work out what the
  difficulty is. Running it through the routing policies would mean a D5 issue
  refines on the flagship tier, which is precisely the escalation the epic
  rules out: flagship is a deliberate operator choice for one expensive
  dispatch, not the default rung for an open-ended chat.

  So `model/1` asks the workspace for its `premium` tier model (falling back to
  the built-in default) and nothing else. `"flagship"` is never a tier this
  module looks up, under any config — the workspace's routing rules are not
  consulted at all, so there is no path by which they could select it.

  Thinking is `high`, chosen over `xhigh`/`max`: refinement is
  reasoning-heavy in bursts — decomposing an epic, arguing about what
  acceptance can actually be checked — but it is also a conversation, and most
  turns in it are short. `xhigh`/`max` pay the deepest reasoning budget on
  every turn including "yes, that one", which burns a quota window on an
  interactive session that may run for an hour. `high` is the level that is
  still genuinely deliberative on the turns that need it.
