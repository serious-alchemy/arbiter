defmodule Arbiter.Sessions.Session do
  @moduledoc """
  One browser-hosted coordinator session — RFC §7.4 item 4
  (`docs/browser-hosted-coordinator-sessions.md`, bd-bpt0ag / phase 1).

  A row is the **durable identity** of a session whose actual process lives
  outside the BEAM entirely: a `systemd-run --user --scope` transient unit
  holding a tmux server holding the agent's PTY (§4.3). Arbiter keeps no port,
  pid or fd — see `Arbiter.Sessions` — so this table plus the two derived
  names in `Arbiter.Sessions.Naming` are the *whole* of what survives a
  `systemctl --user restart arbiter`, and the boot-time adoption sweep
  (`Arbiter.Sessions.Adoption`) reconciles them against what systemd and tmux
  still have running.

  ## Fields

    * `name` — an operator-supplied display name (bd-o2vtsz), passed through to
      `claude --name` at launch (`Arbiter.Sessions.Provisioning`) so Arbiter and
      the session agree. **Not** the cwd-derived name Claude Code keeps in its
      own `sessions/<pid>.json` — every session's cwd basename is the literal
      string `workspace`, so that name collides across the whole fleet and is
      never used as a display label. `nil` means no operator name was given;
      `Arbiter.Sessions.DisplayName.resolve/1` is the one place that decides
      what to show instead (the session's own `ai-title`, then a short id).
      Settable at create and updatable afterwards via `:rename`, but a rename
      is **Arbiter-side only** — there is no way to safely rewrite a live
      session's own `sessions/<pid>.json` from outside, so a later rename does
      not reach Claude Code's prompt box / `/resume` picker / terminal title
      for a session already running. Only `--name` at launch does.
    * `provider` — which agent CLI runs in the pane: `:claude_code` (the
      default) or `:agy` (Antigravity, bd-7xuvfl). The launch command itself is
      behind `Arbiter.Sessions.Provider`, so a provider is an adapter, not a
      schema change. An `:agy` row is held to mode B with no Remote Control
      (see `validations`): its credential is the operator's own Google grant,
      and Remote Control's bridge verification reads Claude Code's JSONL.
    * `kind` — `:coordinator` (the default: today's behaviour) or `:login`
      (bd-98oj3s, the dashboard login relay). A `:login` session is
      **unprivileged and hidden**: `Arbiter.Sessions.list/1` omits it unless
      asked (`include_kinds: [:login]`), it is never issued an MCP token (its row
      is born with `mcp_token_revoked_at` set, and `can_dispatch` is forced off),
      and it runs on its own tmux socket under `arb-login-<account>-<nonce>`
      names (`Arbiter.Sessions.Naming`). `login_account` is required for it.
    * `workspace_id` — **nullable on purpose**. `nil` means a cross-workspace
      session, which is the coordinator's normal shape (decision 6: a
      workspace-agnostic coordinator token). A bound session is one deliberately
      scoped to one workspace.
    * `issue_id` — the issue a **refine session** is bound to (bd-1lszsc);
      `nil` for every other session. Set, it changes what token the session
      gets (`:refine` tier, not `:coordinator`) and is held to one live row
      per issue by a partial unique index. See the attribute's own docs.
    * `scope_unit` / `tmux_socket` — the OS handles, derived from `id` at create
      time and never accepted from a caller. Stored rather than only computed so
      a row remains self-describing if the naming scheme ever changes under it.
    * `root_dir` / `config_dir` / `cwd` — the §9.1 scaffold: the session's own
      directory, its `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and the agent's working directory.
      Like `scope_unit` / `tmux_socket` these are **derived from the id** at
      create time (`Arbiter.Sessions.Layout`) rather than accepted, which is
      §10.2 layer 1 — "scaffold, never point at a checkout" (decision 4) — made
      structural: a caller cannot aim a session at the live source tree because
      it cannot choose the path at all. `config_dir` stays nullable for the
      phase-1 rows that predate provisioning, and is always `nil` for a
      provider that has no config dir (`Arbiter.Sessions.Provider.config_dir?/1`
      — agy, whose configuration lives under its `$HOME` instead).
    * `can_dispatch` — whether this session's MCP token may dispatch workers.
      Defaults **off** (§10.1 dispatch recursion); switching it on is a
      deliberate pre-launch choice.
    * `mcp_token_revoked_at` — when the session's MCP token stopped verifying.
      Scope tokens are stateless signed blobs with no revocation table, so the
      row *is* the revocation handle (§9.3): `Arbiter.MCP.Scope.from_token/1`
      reads this column for any token carrying a `session_id` claim. Ending a
      session — killed, failed launch, or the sweep finding the scope gone —
      sets it.
    * `provider_session_id` — the **current** provider-side session id, i.e. the
      basename of the JSONL the CLI is appending to. Nullable at launch (the CLI
      picks it), and **updated on rollover**: a long session that hits
      `--resume`/compaction rolls onto a new id, and §7.5 is explicit that the
      row must track the current one, not the launch one. This is the string
      `Arbiter.Usage.Event.session_id` carries, which is how ledger rows join
      back to a session (`Arbiter.Sessions.usage_events/1`).
    * `auth_mode` — `:seeded_credentials` (mode B, the default per Amendment 2 —
      the operator's own grant copied into the session config dir, and the only
      mode Remote Control works under) or `:oauth_token` (mode A, a revocable
      per-workspace token, no Remote Control). See §8.1.
    * `remote_control` — whether the session was launched with
      `--remote-control` (§8). Refused at create time unless `auth_mode` is
      `:seeded_credentials` (see `validations`) — §8.3 measured mode A
      accepting the flag and starting normally with no bridge ever coming up.
    * `started_at` / `ended_at` / `last_client_at` — lifecycle. `last_client_at`
      is the idle-deadline input for phase 10's reaper (§4.6 item 2).
    * `last_turn_at` — a turn happened (JSONL rollover, a usage event), which is
      activity distinct from a client merely being attached. `Arbiter.Sessions.IdleReaper`
      takes the newer of `last_client_at` / `last_turn_at` / `started_at` as
      "last activity" (§4.6 item 2, phase 10).
    * `keep_alive` — the operator's pin against the idle-TTL sweep (§4.6 item
      2). Defaults `false`: a session is reapable unless someone deliberately
      opts it out.
    * `status` — `:starting` (row written, scope not yet confirmed), `:running`
      (scope live), `:ended` (gone, for any reason).
    * `end_reason` — free text saying *why* it ended: an operator kill, a failed
      launch, or the adoption sweep finding the scope vanished. §4.6 requires the
      sweep to record a reason rather than silently flipping rows.
    * `bridge_status` — `nil` until §8.3's bridge-verification poll finds no
      `bridge-session` record, then `:unavailable` (`mark_bridge_unavailable`,
      bd-cdretj). `Arbiter.Sessions.broadcast_error/2`'s live PubSub signal for
      the same event only reaches a client already attached when it fires —
      normally nobody, since verification runs in the ~15s right after launch —
      so this is what a client attaching afterwards has to go on instead.

  ## No FK to the ledger

  `Usage.Event.session_id` references a session **by string**, deliberately
  (§7.4 item 4: "no FK churn"). It holds the *provider* session id for rows the
  existing ingest writes, and a session can roll through several of those, so a
  foreign key would be wrong as well as expensive.
