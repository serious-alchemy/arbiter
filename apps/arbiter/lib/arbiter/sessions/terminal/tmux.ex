defmodule Arbiter.Sessions.Terminal.Tmux do
  @moduledoc """
  The real `Arbiter.Sessions.Terminal`: `tmux`, addressed by exact socket path
  (bd-3ymdvi, phase 4 of `docs/browser-hosted-coordinator-sessions.md` §5).

  Every operation is one `tmux -S <socket> … -t coord` invocation run through
  the injectable `Arbiter.Sessions.Runner`, so it inherits phase 1's two
  properties for free: the release-env scrub (`Runner.Host`, bd-2oelme) and
  "the call has already finished when it returns". Nothing here retains a
  handle — the live byte stream is a file `tmux` writes and
  `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream` reads.

  ## Addressing

  The socket path and the session name (`coord`) are exact strings derived
  from the session id by `Arbiter.Sessions.Naming`. Never a pattern, never a
  glob — this repo has an incident class around pattern-matching process
  control, and a `-t` that resolved loosely would type a browser's keystrokes
  into somebody else's pane.

  ## stdin as hex

  `send-keys -H` takes hex byte values, which is the only shape that survives
  arbitrary input: a literal `send-keys -l` argument would have tmux's key-name
  parsing, shell quoting and UTF-8 validation between the browser and the pane,
  and a terminal stream contains `C-c`, arrow-key escape sequences and
  half-characters from a split paste. Hex has none of that. Large pastes are
  chunked so argv stays a sane length.

  ## Capture and stderr

  `capture-pane -p` writes the pane's *contents* to stdout, so these calls
  deliberately do **not** set `:stderr_to_stdout` — a tmux warning folded into
  that stream would be rendered in the browser as if the agent had printed it.
  Failures are read from the exit status instead.

  # `capture-pane -p` is plain text: it carries neither the pane's cursor
  # position nor a `\r` before each `\n` (tmux's own line buffer has no `\r`,
  # only line boundaries). xterm is constructed with `convertEol: false`
  # (`session_terminal.mjs`) so it never supplies the missing `\r` on its own,
  # and without the cursor a repaint leaves xterm's cursor wherever the last
  # written byte put it rather than where tmux's own cursor sits — Claude
  # Code's next escape-relative redraw then lands in the wrong place (bd-c5udkj).
  #
  # Both are fixed here, once, so every snapshot caller (a fresh reader's
  # opening capture in `start_stream/3`, and a live re-capture in `snapshot/2`)
  # gets the same treatment: `finalize_capture/1` rewrites bare `\n` to `\r\n`
  # and appends a CUP escape built from the pane's cursor position. The cursor
  # is fetched in the *same* tmux invocation as the capture (chained with `;`,
  # same trick `start_stream/3` already used to pair `pipe-pane` with its
  # opening capture) rather than a second shell-out, so there is no seam for
  # the pane to move its cursor in between. It is prefixed with SOH/STX
  # (`\x01`/`\x02`) — control bytes no real terminal output uses — so it can be
  # split off the front of the capture unambiguously.
