defmodule Arbiter.Sessions.RefineLifecycle do
  @moduledoc """
  Ends a refine session when its bound issue leaves the conversation behind
  it: the operator decision recorded in `Arbiter.Sessions.RefineDoctrine`
  (child 4 of epic bd-cksar2, bd-cvfjms) is that a refine session has no
  further work once its bound issue is promoted or closed — promotion is the
  handoff, and a close means the issue is no longer worth refining.

  Subscribes to the same `"tasks"` PubSub topic `Arbiter.Workflows.
  PatrolLifecycle` already reacts to (`Issue.broadcast_lifecycle/2`), and
  reacts to exactly two shapes:

    * `{:task_lifecycle, :updated, %Issue{refined: true}}` — the issue this
      event names just got promoted (via `ticket_promote`, whether the
      session's own call or anyone else's, or the `Move to Ready` button).
      Ends with `end_reason: "promoted"`.
    * `{:task_lifecycle, :closed, issue}` — ends with `end_reason:
      "issue_closed"`.

  Every other `:task_lifecycle` event (including a plain `:updated` that
  leaves `refined` false — an edit, a title change) is ignored outright: only
  these two shapes can possibly be the bound issue's terminal transition.

  ## Scoped by construction, not by tracking state

  There is no bookkeeping here of "which issue is this session bound to" —
  `Arbiter.Sessions.Refine.live_session/1` is queried fresh for `issue.id` on
  every matching event, and a `:none` result (no live refine session bound to
  *this* issue) is silently a no-op. That is what keeps promoting a **child**
  issue from ending the session that filed it: a child has its own `id`, so
  its `:updated` event never matches the bound issue's `live_session/1`
  lookup. `Arbiter.Sessions.RefineDoctrine` tells the agent to promote the
  bound issue **last** of the batch, because promoting it ends this session
  and revokes its token immediately — but this module itself does not
  enforce that order; it can only end the session once the bound issue's own
  promotion actually lands, whenever that happens to be.

  ## Why `:promote_to_ready` broadcasts post-commit

  `Issue.broadcast_lifecycle/2` for `:promote_to_ready` fires from an
  `after_transaction` hook (matching `:close`'s own reasoning, stated on that
  action: a separate-connection subscriber must see the committed row). This
  module writes a fallback summary note to the same issue row it just read
  off the broadcast (`ensure_summary/2`) — reading and writing that row from
  this process, before the promoting transaction has committed, would be the
  exact race `:close`'s comment warns about.

  ## The refinement summary fallback

  The refine doctrine instructs the agent to write a short summary via
  `ticket_update`'s `notes` field before promoting. An agent that promotes
  without ever writing one (it ran out of context, or just forgot) must not
  leave the issue with nothing — so `ensure_summary/2` writes a plain system
  note only when `notes` is still blank at end time. This only runs when a
  *live* refine session actually ends here; an issue promoted with no live
  refine session bound to it (e.g. from the dashboard, long after any refine
  session on it had already ended) gets no note from this module at all. It
  never
  overwrites a summary the agent did write.

  ## Gating

  Same switch as `Arbiter.Workflows.PatrolLifecycle`:
  `:arbiter, :auto_start_refineries` (default `true`, `false` in test) — off
  by default in the suite so a global instance started by the application
  tree never touches an issue/session outside the sandbox connection a given
  test allowed it. Tests that need this behavior start their own named
  instance with `enabled?: true` (and usually `runner: SessionRunnerStub`).
