defmodule Arbiter.Sessions do
  @moduledoc """
  Ash domain + lifecycle API for browser-hosted coordinator sessions
  (`docs/browser-hosted-coordinator-sessions.md`, phase 1 / bd-bpt0ag).

  ## The one load-bearing property

  **Arbiter holds no long-lived handle to the PTY.** Not a `Port`, not a pid,
  not a file descriptor, not a linked process. A session is launched as

      systemd-run --user --scope --unit=arb-session-<id> --collect \\
        tmux -S $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/arbiter/session-<id>.sock \\
             new-session -d -s coord -x <cols> -y <rows> -e … "<agent command>"

  and from then on every control operation — kill, enumerate, adopt — shells
  out to `tmux` or `systemctl --user` and exits. The session's processes live
  in a transient systemd **scope**, which is a *sibling* cgroup of
  `arbiter.service`, so `systemctl --user restart arbiter` cannot reach them
  (§4.1: `arbiter.service` has no `KillMode`, so systemd's default
  `KillMode=control-group` signals every process in the unit's cgroup — and
  `setsid`, daemonising and double-forking do **not** move a process between
  cgroups, which is why the intuitive "detach it" answer was measured dead).

  Restart survival is therefore true *by construction* rather than by careful
  coding: there is no supervision link to sever. `Arbiter.Sessions.Adoption`
  rediscovers sessions after a restart by listing scope units and sockets.

  ## API

    * `launch/1` — create the row, then start the scope. Returns the row with
      `status: :running`.
    * `list/0,1` — every session, newest first; `list(status: :running)` for the
      live ones.
    * `get/1` — one session by id.
    * `kill/2` — tmux `kill-session` then `systemctl --user stop` the scope, and
      record `ended_at` + a reason. Refuses to kill the **caller's own** session
      (§10.1; see `Arbiter.Sessions.Guards`).
    * `usage_events/1` — the ledger rows attributable to a session, joined by
      string on the *provider* session id (§7.4 item 4).

  ## Provisioning (phase 3)

  `launch/1` now **provisions before it launches**
  (`Arbiter.Sessions.Provisioning`): the §9.1 directory tree, an interactive
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` with the three §9.2 onboarding gates pre-answered, a
  generated `CLAUDE.md`, and a `.mcp.json` carrying a per-session revocable
  coordinator token. A provisioning failure aborts the launch and ends the row
  — a session launched against an unseeded config dir does not fail, it hangs
  on a wizard nobody can click through.

  ## Phase boundaries

  The browser transport and UI, Remote Control, and the memory layers
  themselves are later phases; phase 3 leaves only the §9.4 mount points.

  ## Secrets

  Nothing secret goes on a command line. `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is world-readable
  on this host and this repo has an incident class around exactly that (§10.3),
  so the only env reaching the pane through `tmux -e` is non-secret
  (`ARB_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`). Mode A's OAuth token is written to a
  mode-`0600` file the launch wrapper sources; mode B's credential is a copy
  inside the session's config dir. Neither is ever an argv token, and neither
  is ever written to the row.

  @doc """
  Launch a session: write the row, then start its systemd scope.

  The row comes first because the scope's *name* is derived from the session id
  (`Arbiter.Sessions.Naming`) — so a scope can never exist that no row points
  at, which is the invariant the adoption sweep relies on to tell "mine" from
  "somebody else's". A launch that fails leaves the row behind marked `:ended`
  with the failure as its reason, rather than deleting it: a failed launch is
  something an operator wants to see, and the sweep must not confuse it with a
  live session.

  ## Options

    * `:cwd` — the agent's working directory. **Optional since phase 3**: the
      default is the scaffolded `<sessions_root>/<id>/workspace`, because
      decision 4 / §10.2 layer 1 is that a session is scaffolded rather than
      pointed at an existing checkout.
    * `:provider` — `:claude_code` (default) or `:agy` (bd-7xuvfl; see
      `Arbiter.Sessions.Provider.Agy`). An agy session has no config dir, is
      mode B only and never carries Remote Control.
    * `:workspace_id` — `nil` (default) means cross-workspace.
    * `:issue_id` — binds the session to one issue, which makes it a **refine
      session** (bd-1lszsc): its MCP token is minted at the `:refine` tier
      bound to that issue rather than at the coordinator tier, and at most one
      live session may carry a given `issue_id`. Set by
      `Arbiter.Sessions.Refine.open/2`, which is the supported way in.
    * `:config_dir` — override the session's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`; defaults to
      the scaffolded one. Ignored (the row stores `nil`) for a provider with
      no config dir.
    * `:name` — an operator-supplied display name (bd-o2vtsz). Passed through
      as `claude --name`, shell-quoted, in the generated `launch.sh`
      (`Arbiter.Sessions.Provisioning`). `nil` (default) leaves `launch.sh`
      exec'ing a bare `claude`, unchanged from before this option existed.
    * `:auth_mode` — `:seeded_credentials` (default, mode B — Amendment 2) or
      `:oauth_token` (mode A).
    * `:can_dispatch` — default `false` (§10.1).
    * `:remote_control` — recorded; phase 8 acts on it.
    * `:provision` — `false` skips provisioning (the phase-1 shape, used by the
      lifecycle tests that assert only the command). Default `true`.
    * `:cols` / `:rows` — initial pane geometry (default #{@default_cols}x#{@default_rows}).
    * `:runner` — command runner module, for tests. See `Arbiter.Sessions.Runner`.
    * `:ensure_reader` — `false` skips the eager `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream.ensure_reader/2`
      call this function otherwise makes right after `mark_running/1` (§11's
      raw-transcript capture, bd-5pelo2 round 5 finding 1). Default `true`.
      A test that needs precise, deterministic control over exactly when and
      under what terminal the *first* `open_stream/1` happens — driving that
      race itself rather than racing an eager background start — wants
      `false` here (see `ArbiterWeb.SessionChannelTest`'s `on_start_stream`
      hook, which only fires once, on whichever call opens the reader first).
    * `:verify_bridge` — `false` skips the §8.3 bridge-verification poll this
      function otherwise starts (in the background, via `Arbiter.TaskSupervisor`)
      when `remote_control: true`. Default `true`. A row with `remote_control:
      false` never starts one regardless of this option — there is no bridge
      to verify.
    * `:bridge_verify_fun` — override for `Arbiter.Sessions.BridgeVerification.verify/2`,
      for tests that want to control the outcome without waiting on a poll.
    * `:bridge_verify_timeout_ms` / `:bridge_verify_poll_interval_ms` — passed
      straight through to the verifier (defaults
      #{@default_bridge_verify_timeout_ms}ms / #{@default_bridge_verify_poll_interval_ms}ms).
      A test asserting the timeout path wants both small.

    * `:runner` — command runner module, for tests.

  phase has been writing since bd-be804c join to a session row the moment one
  exists for them.

  Returns `[]` for a session that has not yet been assigned a provider session
  id — with no key there is nothing to join on, which is not the same as "no
  spend", and phase 7's HUD is where that distinction gets surfaced.
