defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue do
  @moduledoc """
  Per-workspace merge-queue GenServer. Picks up "worker done" events,
  opens MRs/PRs (or merges directly per workspace config), polls them for
  approval + CI, merges with the configured strategy, and transitions
  tasks to `:closed` when the merge lands.

  ## Lifecycle

      start_link(workspace_id: ws.id)
        │
        ▼
      subscribes to PubSub topic "worker:done:" <> workspace_id
        │
        ▼
      receives {:worker_done, task_id}
        │
        ▼
      loads task → resolves merge adapter → opens MR (or skips for :direct)
        │
        ▼
      tick/0 (every poll_interval_ms) → polls in-flight MRs → merges → closes task

  ## State machine (per in-flight item)

  The status is an explicit atom enum, not a polymorphic struct or behaviour:

      :opening
        │   adapter.open succeeded
        ▼
      :awaiting_approval
        │   approved == true
        ▼
      :ci_running
        │   ci_clean == true
        ▼
      :ready_to_merge
        │   adapter.merge accepted
        ▼
      :merging
        │   merge confirmed
        ▼
      :done   →   task transitioned to :closed, item removed

  Errors anywhere set status to `:failed` and stop further polling on that
  item; the task is NOT closed on failure. The reviewer can drive recovery
  manually.

  ## Auto-resolved merge conflicts (bd-dolcqq)

  When `adapter.get` reports `conflicting: true` we used to
  freeze the item and wait for a human rebase — twice in one morning that
  meant a coordinator page on parallel dispatcher-task waves. Now the MergeQueue
  side-steps that:

      :awaiting_approval (or any non-terminal status)
        │   adapter.get reports conflicting: true
        ▼
      :conflict_resolving — spawn `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.ConflictResolver`
                            (a swappable behaviour, defaults to a Worker +
                            ClaudeSession running rebase + force-push)
        │   worker pushes resolved branch
        ▼
      (next tick observes conflicting: false; restore_after_resolution/2
       returns the item to its prior status, posts a :notification so the
       coordinator feed sees the auto-rebase succeeded, and the queue resumes)

  Each conflict gets **exactly one** resolver attempt. The resolver is a
  *mechanical* rebase; if a single pass + force-push doesn't unblock the
  MR (the next tick still sees `conflicting: true`), the conflict is almost
  certainly semantic and the MergeQueue posts an `:escalation` mail (via
  `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.ConflictResolver.escalate_unresolved/4`)
  and parks the item `:failed`. Spawn failures (no repo configured,
  worktree creation failed, workspace gone, resolver already running)
  take the same escalation path. Better a loud escalation than a silent
  stall.

  The resolver module is injected via `:conflict_resolver` (start_link opt)
  → `:arbiter, :merge_queue_conflict_resolver` (application env) → the default
  real implementation. Tests pass a stub so they don't spawn real workers.

  ## Base-aware serialized merge (#354, Phase 3)

  Phase 2's conflict resolver (above) is *reactive*: it rebases a PR after a
  conflict has already appeared. The durable fix is to keep in-flight PRs
  continuously rebased as the integration branch moves, and to merge them one
  at a time against a frozen base so two individually-clean PRs can't break
  together when merged in sequence. This is that base-aware serialized merge:

  ### Continuous auto-update-branch

  Every poll, each **approved** item whose PR reports `block_reason:
  :behind_base` (GitHub `mergeable_state == "behind"` — i.e. the base advanced
  under it) is rebased forward via `adapter.update_branch/1` and parked at
  `:updating_base` until the next poll observes it caught up. This surfaces a
  base-introduced conflict *early* (a 1-commit rebase) rather than late (a
  full-PR rebase at merge time): when the rebase can't apply, the very next
  `get/1` reports `conflicting: true` and the existing conflict-resolver path
  (Phase 2) takes over. Adapters without `update_branch/1` simply skip this
  step — the queue degrades to its pre-Phase-3 behaviour. Note: the `Direct`
  adapter implements `update_branch/1` but bypasses the queue entirely (it
  transitions to `:done` immediately on enqueue), so Phase 3 rebase logic is
  moot for Direct-strategy tasks.

  ### Serialized merge admission

  `poll_all/1` advances every item up to — but not through — the merge: an
  approved, CI-clean, up-to-date item parks at `:ready_to_merge` instead of
  merging inline. A second queue-level pass (`admit_one_merge/2`) then merges
  **at most one** item per cycle: the front of the queue, ordered by task
  priority then enqueue time. After it merges, `main` advances; on the next
  poll the followers report `:behind_base`, are `update_branch`'d onto the new
  head, and only then become eligible — so each PR rebases onto the post-merge
  head before its own merge. A PR that was `:ready_to_merge` but is now behind
  (because the base moved) drops back to `:updating_base` automatically.

  This governs the **queue-driven** merge lane (auto-merge off, the merge queue is
  the merger). The per-worker Watchdog's review-gate fast-merge is the explicit
  non-queued bypass and is unaffected.

  ## Auto-revise on requested changes (bd-95lsjb)

  When `adapter.get` reports a CHANGES_REQUESTED review (the latest verdict
  per reviewer) newer than the last one the queue handled, the MergeQueue
  dispatches a single revise pass on the **existing worktree** instead of
  idling at `:awaiting_approval`:

      :awaiting_approval
        │   adapter.get reports changes_requested: true with a new
        │   latest_review_id (not yet debounced)
        ▼
      :changes_requested — fetch the full feedback
                           (`adapter.list_review_feedback/1`), post a brief
                           acknowledging comment, then spawn
                           `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.ReviseDispatcher` (the
                           `arb resume` path: a fresh worker on the task's
                           preserved worktree + `pr_ref`, briefed with the
                           reviewer feedback). It commits + pushes to the SAME
                           branch — no new PR (pairs with bd-53xrmi).
        │   next tick
        ▼
      :awaiting_approval (re-review) — the review id is recorded in
                           `last_handled_review_id`, so the same
                           CHANGES_REQUESTED (still in the PR's review history)
                           is not actioned twice. A later APPROVE supersedes it
                           (latest-verdict-per-reviewer) and advances to merge
                           as today.

  Each distinct CHANGES_REQUESTED review gets **exactly one** revise pass. A
  dispatch failure parks the item `:failed` (no retry loop). The `Direct`
  merger no-ops (no forge review surface), so direct-strategy tasks are
  unaffected. The dispatcher module is injected via `:revise_dispatcher`
  (start_link opt) → `:arbiter, :merge_queue_revise_dispatcher` (application env)
  → the default real implementation; tests pass a stub.

  ## Merge adapter

  The merge adapter is resolved per task from its repo's effective
  `merge.strategy` (`Arbiter.Mergers.scope/2`: a `merge.repos.<repo>`
  override, else the workspace-level `merge.strategy`, bd-73zv62), so one
  queue can open GitHub PRs for one repo and close another's tasks directly.
  Valid values:

    * `"github"` — `Arbiter.Mergers.Github` adapter (PR-based)
    * `"gitlab"` — `Arbiter.Mergers.Gitlab` adapter (MR-based)
    * `"direct"` — `Arbiter.Mergers.Direct` adapter. **Never opens a
      MR/PR**. The task is immediately transitioned to `:done` (and then
      `:closed`). This is the "personal project" path; the worker is
      assumed to have already pushed + merged its branch out-of-band.

  ## PubSub topic

  Subscribes to `"worker:done:" <> workspace_id`. Per-workspace because
  each MergeQueue process runs against exactly one workspace and shouldn't
  see other workspaces' events. The worker (or the orchestrator that
  drives it) is responsible for broadcasting to that topic when its
  workflow completes successfully.

  Subscribers to `"merge_queue:" <> workspace_id` will receive
  `{:task_closed_by_merge_queue, task_id}` once the merge lands.

  ## Supervision

  This GenServer is **NOT** started under `Arbiter.Application` by
  default. Workspaces are dynamic — there's no static list to enumerate at
  boot — so a future supervisor (gte-024 territory) will start one
  merge_queue per workspace lazily. For now, tests and CLI tools start it
  manually with `start_link/1`.

  ## Configuration knobs (start_link/1 opts)

    * `:workspace_id` (string, required) — the workspace this merge_queue serves.
    * `:name` — process name (default `__MODULE__`).
    * `:poll_interval_ms` — how often `:tick` fires (default 30_000).
    * `:base` — an explicit *queue-level* base override. It sits **below** a
      task's own `target_branch` and the per-repo default (so those still win),
      but above the workspace `merge.base`. Defaults to `nil`, in which case the
      base is resolved entirely from task/repo/workspace config via
      `Arbiter.Worker.TargetBranch`. Convenient for tests.
    * `:auto_tick` — when `false` (default `true`), the periodic `:tick`
      timer is not scheduled. Tests use `false` and drive ticks via
      `tick/1` so they don't race with real time.
    * `:conflict_resolver` — module implementing the
      `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.ConflictResolver` behaviour. Defaults to
      the real implementation (which spawns a Worker + ClaudeSession);
      tests pass a stub.
    * `:revise_dispatcher` — module implementing the
      `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.ReviseDispatcher` behaviour (bd-95lsjb).
      Defaults to the real implementation (which resumes the task's worktree
      via `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.resume/2`); tests pass a stub.

  #      template when present. This is the canonical, worker-quality body.
  #   2. the task's originating `description` (the ticket spec) — a reasonable
  #      stand-in when no worker body was produced (older tasks, review-only).
  #   3. `PRTemplate.default_body/1` — a minimal `## <title>` + description +
  #      tracker-link body.
  #
  # The final fallback is what root-causes the empty-body incident (#3606):
  # `task.description || ""` returned `""` whenever the local task's
  # description was empty/nil (e.g. the spec lived only upstream), and GitHub
  # injects the repo's bare PR template whenever the body is empty. `pr_body ||
  # description || default_body` is *always* non-empty (default_body always
  # carries the title), so the MergeQueue can never again open a bare-template PR.
  # The task is fetched fresh via `Ash.get/2` in `do_enqueue/2`, which selects
  # all attributes — so `pr_body` and `description` are loaded, never silently
