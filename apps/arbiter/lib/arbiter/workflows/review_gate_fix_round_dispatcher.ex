defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.ReviewGateFixRoundDispatcher do
  @moduledoc """
  Auto-dispatch an implementer **fix round** after the ReviewGate returns a
  `request_changes` verdict (bd-a9zb7w, #1544).

  ## The gap this closes

  `Arbiter.Worker.park_rejected/3` records the run `:failed` with
  `failure_reason: :review_gate_rejected`, escalates the findings, and stops.
  Nothing then dispatched the implementer: the task sat `:in_progress` with no
  live worker until a human ran `worker_resume`. Seven occurrences over
  2026-09-09/10 (vs-ciouz8, vs-382bg7, vs-bg7rue, vs-8q9xu8 ×2, vs-2d0xxa,
  vs-7fv3n4) were every one of them cleared by a plain manual `worker_resume`
  that took immediately — nothing was structurally blocking the implementer, it
  simply was never scheduled. vs-ciouz8 sat overnight and blocked a whole epic
  chain behind it.

  This is the mirror of bd-di4t6d / #1537, which re-dispatches the *reviewer*
  out of `:awaiting_review`. Here the reviewer already ran and produced a
  verdict; the missing actor is the implementer and the terminal state is
  `:review_gate_rejected`, a different branch entirely.

  ## Rejected-and-fixable vs. rejected-and-converged

  Not every rejection deserves another implementer. The worker
  (`Arbiter.Worker.maybe_dispatch_fix_round/3`) applies three gates before
  calling `dispatch/1`, and escalates through `escalate_exhausted/4` instead of
  dispatching when any of them says stop:

    * **verdict** — only `:request_changes` gets a fix round. A `:no_verdict`
      rejection (`:review_gate_inconclusive`) means the reviewer produced
      nothing actionable; handing an implementer an empty finding set is not a
      fix round, it is a coin flip. Those still escalate as they always did.
    * **budget** — `meta[:review_gate_fix_round_attempts]` counts fix rounds
      that already ran for this task, re-stamped on each resumed worker by
      `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch` (the same mechanism bd-8eheb6 uses for
      `:awaiting_review_resume_attempts`; a fresh worker per round means the
      counter has to ride the meta or the cap would never bind). The cap is
      `config["review_gate"]["max_fix_rounds"]`, default 1 (see
      `default_max_fix_rounds/0`); `0` restores the pre-bd-a9zb7w behaviour
      exactly.
    * **convergence** — if this rejection's findings are byte-identical to the
      set the previous fix round was dispatched against
      (`meta[:review_gate_findings_digest]`), the round moved nothing. Another
      identical round would burn the budget to reach the same escalation later,
      so it escalates now as `:not_converging`.

  Bounding it this way is the whole point: an unbounded "rejected → re-dispatch"
  edge is a retry loop between the gate and the implementer, which is worse than
  the stall it replaces.

  ## Behaviour

  `ReviewGateFixRoundDispatcher` is a behaviour so the worker accepts a
  swappable implementation. The module is resolved per call from
  `Application.get_env(:arbiter, :review_gate_fix_round_dispatcher, __MODULE__)`,
  and the test environment points that at
  `Arbiter.Test.StubFixRoundDispatcher` so the suite never spawns a real agent.

  @typedoc """
  Why no fix round was dispatched (or why the one we tried never ran):

    * `:budget_exhausted` — `max_fix_rounds` fix rounds have already run for
      this task and the gate still rejects. Another one is not obviously
      productive; this is where a human takes over.
    * `:not_converging` — the reviewer raised the *same* findings the last fix
      round was already dispatched against. The round changed nothing the
      reviewer cares about, so repeating it is a loop.
    * `{:dispatch_failed, reason}` — the fix round was in budget and warranted
      but could not start. Typically `:no_outpost` (the worktree was cleaned
      up, so there is nothing to re-attach to and a fresh dispatch is needed
      rather than a resume).
    * `:fabricated_evidence` — the reviewer says the work fabricated or
      falsified its evidence (`Arbiter.Worker.EvidenceIntegrity`, bd-80talz).
      A fix round would hand that back to the same provider, and the reviewer
      can be wrong about provenance too, so a human judges it.
    * `:needs_coordinator` — every `[NOT MET]` criterion in the round's
      findings is one the reviewer marked as needing coordinator/operator
      action rather than another implementer round
      (`Arbiter.Worker.CoordinatorOnlyFindings`, bd-6d3h8m) — e.g. a criterion
      that can only be verified post-merge or post-deploy. Another implementer
      round cannot fix what the reviewer already says it cannot fix.
