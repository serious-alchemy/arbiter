defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.MergedPRFinalizer do
  @moduledoc """
  Per-repo GenServer that sweeps open arbiter tasks with a `pr_ref` and
  finalizes those whose PR was merged on GitHub outside arbiter's merge queue
  (or after the worker/Watchdog for that task was gone).

  ## Problem this solves

  When a PR is merged manually on GitHub — or merged after the worker and its
  `restart: :temporary` Watchdog have already exited — nothing polls for the
  merge. The linked Jira ticket stalls at "In Code Review" and the arbiter task
  stays open indefinitely. This was the root cause of the AX-17892 symptom.

  ## Detection

  On each tick the finalizer:

    1. Queries `Issue` for tasks in this workspace with `pr_ref != nil` and
       `status != :closed`. A task already parked at `:awaiting_verification`
       (bd-9so315) is excluded too: its PR *is* merged, so without that the
       sweep would try to re-finalize it on every tick.
    2. For each, calls `adapter.get(pr_ref)` — the same forge call the Watchdog
       uses — and checks whether `status == :merged`.
    3. If merged, fires `Arbiter.Trackers.Sync.lifecycle(task, :merged)` and
       then closes the task with `close_upstream: true`.

  Tasks whose PR returns an API error (e.g. 404 from a different repo in a
  multi-repo workspace) are silently skipped — the finalizer for the correct
  repo picks them up.

  ## Cost (bd-8y1i58)

  Every call this sweep makes is unattended periodic polling, so it runs under
  the limiter's `:background` class (`Arbiter.GitHub.Limiter.with_priority/3`)
  and is shed before it can starve foreground work or the operator's own `gh`.

  It is also **budgeted**: at most `:max_checks_per_tick` tasks are checked per
  sweep (default 25, app env `:merged_pr_finalizer_max_checks_per_tick`; a
  non-positive value disables the cap). Without it the sweep cost scaled with
  the whole open backlog on every tick — one GitHub call per open task every
  120s — which by itself exhausted the account's hourly quota on an idle fleet.
  The window rolls: `cursor` remembers the last task swept and the next tick
  resumes after it, wrapping at the end, so the tail of a backlog larger than
  one budget is still reached (just later).

  ## Relationship to PRPatrol

  PRPatrol queries `list_open()` (open PRs only, never merged) and deliberately
  uses `tracker_type: :none` on its follow-up tasks to avoid transitioning
  merged PRs. This module works the orthogonal path: it queries open **arbiter
  tasks** that have their own `pr_ref`, and finalizes exactly those.

  In addition, this module sweeps PRPatrol follow-up tasks that were never
  assigned their own `pr_ref` but whose **source PR** has since merged. Two
  formats are handled:

    * Modern: `source_pr` field set (added by bd-ci2jl2, `tracker_type: :none`).
    * Legacy: `tracker_type: :github`, `tracker_ref` is a bare PR number,
      `source_pr` nil (pre-bd-ci2jl2 format).

  **Critical guard:** these tasks are closed local-only — `Sync.lifecycle` is
  NOT invoked. For modern follow-ups `tracker_type: :none` would already
  short-circuit it, but for legacy tasks with `tracker_type: :github` the
  `tracker_ref` is a merged-PR number, and transitioning a merged PR returns
  `Validation Failed` (bd-ci2jl2 hazard). Closing via an explicit
  `close_upstream: false` (bd-2wilou flipped the `:close` action's default to
  `true`) avoids any upstream write-back.

  ## Idempotency

  `Sync.lifecycle/2` is best-effort and logs quietly on a benign non-transition
  (`:transition_not_found`, `:status_unmapped`). The `:close` action on an
  already-closed task is blocked by `GuardStatus` and returns an error, which
  is caught and logged without crashing the sweep.

  ## Lifecycle

  Not in `Application.children`. Started per-workspace via
  `MergedPRFinalizerSupervisor` — one instance per (workspace, repo).
  Test convenience: `tick/1` forces a synchronous sweep.
