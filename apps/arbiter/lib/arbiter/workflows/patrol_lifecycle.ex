defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.PatrolLifecycle do
  @moduledoc """
  Subscribes to the `"tasks"` PubSub topic and starts/stops patrols on demand so
  they exist only while their repo has something to watch (bd-7tr11p).

  This is the event-driven half of lazy patrolling. The boot enumeration
  (`PRPatrolSupervisor.start_for_existing_workspaces/0` /
  `ReviewPatrolSupervisor.start_for_existing_workspaces/0`) starts patrols for
  repos that already have committed work; this subscriber keeps them in step
  afterwards, without a server restart:

    * A **new fleet PR** (a task whose `pr_ref` the MergeQueue just stamped) or a
      **new review engagement** (`review_only` task with a `source_pr`) starts
      its repo's patrol.

    * When such an item **closes**, the workspace's patrols are nudged to
      re-check; the one whose last watched item just closed self-terminates.

  ## Why the start path does not re-read the database

  The `:created` / `:updated` lifecycle broadcasts fire inside the action's
  transaction (before commit). A gate that re-read the DB from this separate
  process could race that commit and miss the very item that triggered the
  event. Instead the start path treats the event as proof that watched work
  exists and calls the supervisor's `ensure_started/2`, which resolves the repo
  from the item's ref (no DB read) and starts that repo's patrol optimistically.
  The patrol's own tick/`:recheck` guards (which run well after commit) reconcile
  anything that turns out to be spurious. The **stop** path keys off `:closed`,
  which fires post-commit, so `recheck_all/1`'s DB read sees the closed state.

  Inert unless patrols are configured to auto-start (`auto_start?/0`, off in
  test): it only subscribes when enabled, so it is harmless in the test suite
  while the app's own instance is present in the tree.

      `source_pr` but is not `review_only` and has no `pr_ref` of its own).

  # closed engagement its `source_pr`), so a later `:updated` on it — e.g. a notes
  # edit — would otherwise resurrect a patrol for a repo whose work is already
  # gone. `:verifying` is guarded for the same reason: a parked task's
  # PR is already merged, so its `pr_ref` is exactly as stale as a closed task's,
  # and every recorded verdict (`:record_verification` broadcasts `:updated` while
  # the task is still parked) or coordinator notes edit would otherwise spawn a
