  Shared "required-check failure triage protocol" instructions text

  `Arbiter.Workflows.PRPatrol` files against a PR whose required check(s)
  settled to a failing conclusion.

  A failing required check must not trigger a blind "push something until
  it's green" response — flaky tests are common (the motivating case:
  apex-client#3260/#3263, both the same flaky `call-details.spec`
  transcript-scroll test), and a real regression needs a minimal fix, not a
  workaround. This mirrors `Arbiter.Workflows.ReviewThreadFollowUp`'s
  reply/resolve/escalate shape, but for the CI-triage decision tree instead
  of the review-thread protocol.

    ## Required-check failure triage protocol (bd-ayetel)

    Failing required check(s): #{Enum.join(check_names, ", ")}.

    A CI failure needs triage BEFORE a fix — do not blindly push a change to
    make it green. For each failing check:

      1. Pull the failed job's logs (e.g. `gh run view --log-failed`, or the
         check's own details URL) and determine which of these applies:
           - FLAKE: re-running the same job with no code change passes →
             re-run the failed job(s) and note in the PR that it was a flake.
           - PRE-EXISTING ON BASE: the failure also reproduces on the PR's
             base branch (unrelated to this diff) → report it (a PR comment
             plus an escalation to the coordinator mailbox) rather than
             trying to fix it here.
           - REAL REGRESSION caused by this diff → make the minimal fix and
             commit + push it (a sandboxed run with no forge credential
             cannot push; Arbiter pushes for it).

      2. Never fabricate a green: do not skip/disable the check, do not claim
         a fix worked without observing the actual re-run result, and do not
         report a check as resolved unless it is actually passing.

    If triage is inconclusive, escalate to the coordinator mailbox naming the
    PR and the failing check(s) rather than guessing.
