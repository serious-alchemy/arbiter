defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.CodeReview.Checks do
  @moduledoc """
  Default check runner for `Arbiter.Workflows.CodeReview`.

  Hands the diff to a Claude session and parses structured findings from
  its JSON output. A finding has the shape:

      %{
        severity: :info | :warning | :error,
        file: String.t(),
        line: pos_integer(),
        message: String.t()
      }

  Any finding with `severity: :error` causes the workflow's `:verdict`
  step to return `:request_changes`; otherwise `:approve`.

  ## Indirection — why a runner function, not a hard call

  The workflow looks up the runner indirectly via `state[:check_runner]`
  (defaulting to `&__MODULE__.run/2`), which lets tests inject a stub
  without monkey-patching modules **and** lets callers swap the reviewer
  (`gpt-codex`, `local-static-analyzer`, …) without rewriting the
  workflow.

  ## Test override

  Set `Application.put_env(:arbiter, :code_review_invoker, fun)` where
  `fun` is a `(prompt, state) -> result` function. This bypasses Claude
  entirely. The default invoker shells out to
  `claude --print ... --output-format stream-json`. Tests should always set
  an override to avoid hitting the real CLI.

  `result` is one of:

      {:ok, text}
      {:ok, text, usage}
      {:ok, text, usage, raw_output}
      {:error, reason}
      {:error, reason, raw_output}

  where `raw_output` is the reviewer's unparsed stdout. When present — and
  the state carries a `:review_record_id` — it is persisted as the review's
  durable transcript (`Arbiter.Reviews.Transcript`, bd-7efini) before being
  stripped from the return value, so `run/2`'s callers only ever see the
  3-element shapes.

  ## Output contract from Claude

  Claude is asked to respond with a single JSON object:

      {
        "findings": [
          {"severity": "error|warning|info",
           "file": "path/to/file.ex",
           "line": 42,
           "message": "the issue"}
        ]
      }

  The parser is forgiving: it scans the raw text for the first `{...}`
  JSON object, tolerates surrounding prose, and discards entries that
  don't match the expected shape. If no findings parse, `{:ok, []}` is
  returned (a clean approval).
