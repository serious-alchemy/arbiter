defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.PRPatrol do
  @moduledoc """
  Per-repo GenServer that polls open PRs and dispatches follow-up workers
  when reviews need attention. Replaces the Go GT `mol-pr-feedback-patrol`
  cron loop.

  ## Triggers

  A PR is considered "actionable" when any of these is true:

    * Any review on the PR has `state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED"`
      (highest-priority signal), via `list_review_feedback/1`.

    * The PR has at least one **unresolved review thread / inline review
      comment**, via the adapter's `list_open_review_threads/1` primitive
      (bd-823q7e). This catches a `COMMENTED` review that leaves inline
      comments without requesting changes — e.g. an automated reviewer — which
      the CHANGES_REQUESTED signal alone misses.

      A thread whose LAST comment was posted by us (`Workspace.pr_patrol_our_login/1`,
      falling back to `config["review_patrol"]["our_login"]`) is excluded from
      this count even while still unresolved (bd-45x4yo) — otherwise a thread
      the follow-up protocol forbids resolving (a wrong finding on a bot
      thread, or any human-reviewer thread, which is NEVER auto-resolved)
      stays "unresolved" forever and gets re-filed as an identical follow-up
      on every tick. A new comment from anyone else after ours makes the
      thread actionable again.

    * The PR has at least one **settled, REQUIRED** failing check, via the
      adapter's `list_required_check_failures/1` primitive (bd-ayetel). This
      catches an approved-but-BLOCKED PR whose CI failed silently — no review
      signal fires because nobody requested changes, so without this the PR
      just sits there. Scoped to required checks only (an optional/
      informational check failing must not page anyone) and to settled
      failures only (a required check still running is not yet a failure —
      firing on it would flap every poll until it completes).

  All three signals are read through the provider-agnostic
  `Arbiter.Mergers.Merger` adapter: PRPatrol never sees GitHub GraphQL or
  GitLab discussion shapes, only the normalized `changes_requested` boolean,
  `t:Arbiter.Mergers.Merger.review_thread/0` list, and
  `t:Arbiter.Mergers.Merger.failing_check/0` list. An adapter without a given
  surface (e.g. `Direct`) simply doesn't implement the corresponding
  optional callback; PRPatrol guards each with `function_exported?/3` and
  treats absence as "nothing to report" for that signal.

  ## Dedup

  Each follow-up task records the PR it was filed against in the dedicated
  `source_pr` field (`to_string(pr_number)`), scoped to the patrol's workspace.
  Before dispatching, PRPatrol queries `Issue` for open tasks with that
  combination — if one exists, the PR has already been handled this cycle.

  A follow-up also records the fingerprint of the trigger it was filed for in
  `last_seen_comment_id` (`review:<id>` of the latest CHANGES_REQUESTED review, or
  a hash of the unresolved thread ids + last comment ids). Once it closes
  `:completed`, that trigger is consumed: the same fingerprint files nothing more
  (bd-9uyoy0), and only new activity re-arms the patrol.

  `source_pr` is deliberately NOT `tracker_ref`: `tracker_ref` is the field
  `Arbiter.Trackers.Sync` treats as a writable tracker item to push task
  lifecycle state onto, and a PR number is not a workable tracker issue —
  transitioning a *merged PR* on dispatch fails with `Validation Failed` and
  escalates (bd-ci2jl2). A follow-up therefore carries `tracker_type: :none`
  (no lifecycle write-back) and links its source PR via `source_pr` instead.

  A follow-up whose dispatch fails is closed (see `record_dispatch_failure/4`),
  which frees this dedup check for a retry — a NEW `Issue` (a new task id) is
  filed each retry, not the same one reopened. Left unbounded, a `repo` that
  fails deterministically would file a fresh task forever, one per backoff
  window. `@max_dispatch_attempts` bounds this: once a PR's consecutive
  failure count hits it, PRPatrol gives up on that PR permanently — no more
  follow-ups are filed for it until the patrol restarts (bd-7rxwzc).

  ## The ReviewGate hold (bd-bq8c8a)

  A PR whose authoring task is still inside the `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate` is
  **held**: no follow-up is filed and no fix worker is dispatched, however
  actionable its signals look. While the gate is running it is the authority on
  the diff, and a second actor pushing to the branch behind it invalidates the
  round in progress — see `Arbiter.Reviews.GateActivity` for the incident and
  for what counts as "inside the gate".

  The hold consumes nothing: the threads stay unresolved and no state is
  written, so the first tick after the gate converges files exactly the
  follow-up the held tick declined to.

  ## Lifecycle

  Not in `Application.children`. Started manually per-workspace:

      Arbiter.Workflows.PRPatrol.start_link(
        repo: "acme-corp/apex_server",
        workspace_id: ws.id,
        interval_ms: 60_000
      )

  Test convenience: `tick/1` forces a synchronous patrol cycle without
  waiting for the next interval.
  """

  # `:transient` (not the default `:permanent`) so a patrol that self-terminates
  # because its repo has no watched work (bd-7tr11p) stays down — a `:permanent`
  # child would be restarted immediately by the DynamicSupervisor, defeating the
  # whole lazy-stop. A genuine crash still exits abnormally and is restarted.
  #
  # The start_link/tick/state/handle_call/handle_info/resolve_adapter/
  # schedule_next scaffold is shared with ReviewPatrol via `PatrolServer`
  # (bd-d825hp, resolving the duplication bd-4brb2j flagged) — see its
  # moduledoc for the shape each patrol keeps.

  # therefore re-files a brand new follow-up task forever, one per backoff
  # window, piling up closed task ids indefinitely (bd-7rxwzc — the vstim
  # incident: 4 closed tasks for one PR in under 4 hours, still going). Once a
  # PR's consecutive dispatch-failure count reaches this bound, PRPatrol gives
  # up on it permanently: no further follow-up is filed, and one final
  # escalation tells the coordinator retries have stopped — a human (or a
  # workspace config fix + patrol restart) is required to unstick it.

  # escalations on apex-client#3282). Now the failure is recorded per PR:

  # untouched, so the very next dispatch failure retries it instead of being
  # silently swallowed forever behind "already escalated". Once an escalation
  # does persist, a still-failing PR re-escalates at most every
  # `re_escalate_after_ms`, so a condition that outlives the original message
  # (missed notification, new failure mode) doesn't stay silent indefinitely.

  # meta). `:starting` alone is therefore the load-bearing zombie signal here (see
