defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.PRPatrolSupervisor do
  @moduledoc """
  DynamicSupervisor for PRPatrol processes — one per (workspace, repo) pair
  configured for GitHub merges.

  Single-repo workspaces (those with `config["merge"]["config"]["repo"]` set)
  get exactly one PRPatrol, registered under their `workspace_id`.

  Multi-repo workspaces (no `repo` pinned in the merge config — only an
  `owner`) get one PRPatrol per repo, registered under
  `"workspace_id:owner/repo"`. The repo list is derived from the workspace's
  `repo_paths` map: each locally-checked-out repo's `origin` remote
  is resolved to an `"owner/repo"` slug via `RepoResolver`, the same mechanism
  the worker dispatch path uses. This covers the acme workspace shape, whose
  repos are separate `acme-corp/*` repos that must each be patrolled
  independently — without this, acme (a jira-tracker + github-merger
  workspace) got no patrol at all and Copilot review comments went unaddressed.

  Patrols are registered under `Arbiter.Workflows.PRPatrolRegistry`. Duplicate
  starts collapse to `{:error, {:already_started, pid}}`.

  At application boot, `start_for_existing_workspaces/0` enumerates every
  workspace and starts patrols for those with a GitHub merge config. New
  workspaces start their patrol(s) via the
  `Arbiter.Tasks.Workspace.Changes.StartPRPatrol` after_action hook.

  Both auto-start paths are gated by the `:arbiter, :auto_start_refineries`
  config flag — disabled in `test`, enabled everywhere else.

  Poll interval is read from `:arbiter, :pr_patrol_interval_ms` (default 60s).

  ## Registry-key scheme and 1↔N transitions

  The registry key scheme depends on how many repos resolve for a workspace at
  call time. If a workspace's resolvable-repo count crosses 1↔N between
  restarts (a repo added or removed, or a previously-unreachable remote starts
  resolving), `start_patrol/2` automatically stops any stale patrol registered
  under the old scheme before starting new ones under the new scheme. This
  reconciliation prevents a ghost patrol from running under the wrong key after
  the repo count changes.

  ## Following a workspace config edit (bd-7feiul)

  Each patrol registers with the repo it patrols as its registry value, so a
  patrol still pinned to a repo the workspace no longer resolves to (a moved
  `merge.config.owner` / `repo`, or a changed `repo_paths`) is recognisable
  without calling into it — under the same key, too: a single-repo workspace
  keys its patrol by the bare workspace id whichever repo that is. A workspace
  `:update` / `:patch_config` that changes `config` runs `reconcile/1` (via
  `Arbiter.Tasks.Workspace.Changes.ReconcilePatrols`), which stops every such
  stale patrol and then re-runs the gated `start_patrol/2` — so a replacement
  starts only for a repo the lazy-start gate admits. The demand-start path
  (`ensure_started/2`) sweeps stale patrols the same way before starting, and a
  stale patrol that is still running anyway queries nothing (see
  `PRPatrol.do_tick_body/1`).

  ## Multi-repo workspace create-time deferral

  When a new multi-repo workspace is created, the `StartPRPatrol` after_action
  hook calls `start_patrol/2` immediately. If the workspace's repos are not yet
  checked out at that point, `repos_from_repo_paths/1` returns `[]` and the call
  returns `:skip` — the patrol is deferred to the next application boot via
  `start_for_existing_workspaces/0`. This is intentional: a freshly created
  multi-repo workspace has no repos on disk yet, so there is nothing to patrol.
  The boot-time enumeration catches it once the repos are present.

  ## Observable signals

  A `Logger.info` line is emitted for every patrol started or skipped, so
  operators can confirm which workspaces are covered without querying the
  `PRPatrolRegistry` directly.
