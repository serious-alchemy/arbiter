defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.ReviewPatrol do
  @moduledoc """
  Per-(workspace, repo) GenServer that polls **open review engagements** and
  drives their lifecycle. The reviewer-side mirror of `PRPatrol`: where PRPatrol
  watches PRs the fleet *authored* and files follow-up work, ReviewPatrol watches
  PRs the fleet is *reviewing* (long-lived `review_only` engagements) and keeps
  the engagement in step with the upstream PR.

  ## What is an "engagement"

  A review engagement is an `Issue` with `review_only == true` and a `source_pr`
  set — a long-lived task created when the fleet is asked to review someone
  else's PR (bd-cw3w9p made these tasks long-lived: the Driver / MergeQueue no
  longer auto-close them after the first verdict, so ReviewPatrol owns closure).

  ## Query / dedup

  Each tick selects `review_only == true and not is_nil(source_pr) and
  status != :closed`, scoped to the patrol's `workspace_id`. The `review_only`
  predicate is the hard boundary that keeps ReviewPatrol from colliding with
  PRPatrol's author-side follow-ups: those are filed with `review_only == false`
  (they take the normal implementation path), so they are never selected here.

  ## Per-engagement action

  For each engagement, `adapter.get(source_pr)`:

    * `:merged` or `:closed` → **terminate the engagement**: close the task via
      the `:close` action. Because the task is `review_only`, `SyncTracker`
      short-circuits and the close fires ZERO tracker writes (bd-6xaaam). The
      query already excludes `:closed` tasks, so re-ticking an already-terminated
      engagement is a no-op (idempotent).

    * `:open` with `last_reviewed_sha` **unset** → record the PR head SHA (first
      sighting). No review is dispatched here — the first pass is `arb review` at
      engagement-creation time.

    * `:open` with `last_reviewed_sha` **set** and `head_sha` **advanced** → a
      candidate for new-commit re-review, gated by the spam guards below (task D).

    * any adapter error → no-op for that engagement (logged); the tick still
      completes and bumps the counter so callers can see the patrol is alive.

  ## New-commit re-review (bd-f3fg22)

  When a PR head advances past `last_reviewed_sha`, ReviewPatrol re-reviews — but
  only under a stack of guards that keep it from spamming the PR:

    * **Automation mode** — the engagement's `review_automation` (task B) decides
      *whether* we re-review at all: `:auto` re-reviews automatically; `:flag`
      only surfaces the new commits as a mailbox flag. A bare SHA advance is not a
      trigger on its own.

    * **Relevance gate** — the new commits must touch a file we previously flagged
      (`posted_findings`). A push that touches only unrelated files is not our
      concern and does NOT trigger a re-review.

    * **Sticky approval** (bd-4po0nv) — once the operator identity holds a
      CURRENT approving review on the PR (`adapter.self_approved?/1`, the same
      optional capability the external-review dispatch guard uses, bd-7z5pi5),
      a push does NOT trigger a re-review unless it *invalidates* that
      approval. Invalidating means the new diff touches at least one file that
      is neither a doc file nor a test file with a substantive (non-
      formatting-only) change — see `invalidating_diff?/1`. A doc-only,
      test-only, formatting-only, or rebase/merge-only push (nothing
      substantive in the new diff) is declined: the decision is appended to
      the engagement's `notes` (so "approval is sticky" reads as a deliberate
      decision rather than ReviewPatrol going quiet) and `last_reviewed_sha`
      still advances, so the same push is never re-evaluated. Adapters without
      `self_approved?/1`, or a call that errors, fail OPEN — this gate never
      applies and behavior is unchanged from before this feature. Colleagues
      can still get a response after an approval stands via the author-reply
      path below (no new commits required).

    * **Debounce** — at most one re-review per configurable window
      (`config["review_patrol"]["debounce_ms"]`, then the `:review_patrol_debounce_ms`
      app env, default 5 min). A burst of pushes yields one re-review. We also wait
      for CI to *settle* (not pending/running) before firing.

    * **Review cap** — once `review_count` reaches a configurable ceiling
      (`config["review_patrol"]["max_reviews"]`, then the `:review_patrol_max_reviews`
      app env, default 3), ReviewPatrol stops re-reviewing the PR entirely (no diff
      fetch, no model spend) and instead raises ONE coordinator escalation the first
      time the cap is hit (`review_cap_escalated`), so a PR that keeps looping (e.g.
      a re-flagged phantom finding) is capped rather than accumulating reviews
      indefinitely (bd-ahvk03). `review_count` is a backstop only — sticky
      approval above is what stops *routine* re-review; the cap exists for the
      case where re-review keeps legitimately re-triggering (e.g. a recurring
      finding). The escalation is claimed atomically (`claim_review_cap_escalation/1`,
      a single `UPDATE ... WHERE review_cap_escalated = false`) rather than via
      a plain read-then-write, so it fires exactly once per trip even under
      concurrent evaluation of the same engagement (bd-4po0nv: a read-then-write
      race was observed to emit 7 identical escalations for one trip within ~3s).

    * **New-diff-only** — the re-review diffs `last_reviewed_sha..head_sha` (the
      adapter's compare endpoint), never the whole PR, so comments land only on the
      newly-pushed commits.

    * **Never re-post an unchanged finding** — new findings are de-duped against
      `posted_findings` by `{file, line, message}` before anything is posted.

    * **Never re-raise a settled thread** — see *Thread memory* below.

  On a completed re-review we append the newly-posted findings to `posted_findings`
  and advance `last_reviewed_sha` to `head_sha` (and stamp `last_reviewed_at`).

  ## Author-reply handling (bd-8fg64x)

  When the head has NOT advanced (no new commits this tick), ReviewPatrol instead
  looks for **author replies** on the review threads we own. Using task E's
  reader (`list_open_review_threads/1` + `filter_to_our_threads/2`) it keeps only
  the threads WE participated in — identified by the fleet's own login
  (`config["review_patrol"]["our_login"]`) — and within those, the comments newer
  than `last_seen_comment_id` authored by the PR author. Comments by other
  reviewers (and our own) are ignored (decision 6).

  A new author reply is handled by the engagement's `review_automation` mode:

    * `:auto` — dispatch the distinct `ReviewReply` workflow (task F) to answer
      in-thread. A *code-change* discussion (new commits pushed) is handled by
      the re-review path above instead: the head-advanced branch runs first, so a
      push defers to task D rather than getting an in-thread reply.

    * `:flag` — post NOTHING to the PR; raise exactly ONE addressed coordinator
      escalation (`to_ref: "coordinator"`) with the PR link + reply snippet.

  Either way we advance `last_seen_comment_id` past the handled reply so it is
  processed (or escalated) exactly once, never per-tick.

  ## Thread memory across re-review rounds (bd-cccjtn)

  The reply handling above and the verdict pass used to be blind to each other.
  The author would refute a finding with a `file:line` citation, our own reply
  handler would sometimes concede it outright ("my comment was wrong.
  Resolving."), and the next verdict pass would read the diff cold and re-raise
  the finding — occasionally verbatim. On the 2026-09-09 incident, round 4
  re-raised 9 of the 10 findings the author had answered, two of which we had
  already conceded.

  `Arbiter.Workflows.ReviewPatrol.ThreadMemory` closes that loop. A thread we
  own is **settled** when we conceded it, it was resolved, or the author refuted
  it with a cited `file:line` (a bare "seems fine to me" settles nothing).
  Settled threads are persisted on the engagement as `settled_threads` — they
  have to be, because `list_open_review_threads/1` returns only UNRESOLVED
  threads, so a conceded-then-resolved thread leaves no trace on the forge.

  Three write points feed it, so the memory survives every ordering of push and
  reply:

    * the reply-handling tick folds current thread state in on every
      head-unchanged tick, whatever the automation mode;
    * `dispatch_reply/6` records a concession the moment our reply posts — the
      only moment it is observable;
    * the re-review path refreshes from the live threads immediately before
      dispatching the reviewer, which covers an author who answers our findings
      AND pushes inside the same window.

  Two read points consume it, and deliberately both — a prompt alone is
  advisory. The reviewer prompt carries the settled threads (our finding, the
  author's reply, why it is settled, and that a re-raise must name what
  changed), and the check-runner wrapper DROPS any finding anchored within a few
  lines of a settled thread unless the new commits actually add a line in that
  window. Settled stays settled on a fixed head; new code on those lines
  re-opens the question.

  ## Hard invariant

  ReviewPatrol may only ever dispatch `review_only` sub-runs. It must NEVER call
  the Work / implementation path (`Arbiter.Worker.start/1` for a normal task). The
  re-review runs `Arbiter.Workflows.CodeReview` in `:adapter` mode through the
  `review_agent` model slot — read the diff, post inline comments, submit a single
  verdict — and posts nothing else.

  ## Lifecycle

  Not in `Application.children` directly — started per-(workspace, repo) by
  `Arbiter.Workflows.ReviewPatrolSupervisor`, gated by the same
  `:auto_start_refineries` flag PRPatrol uses. Registered in the SEPARATE
  `Arbiter.Workflows.ReviewPatrolRegistry` (never PRPatrol's).

  Test convenience: `tick/1` forces a synchronous patrol cycle without waiting
  for the next interval.

  ## Rate-limit circuit breaker (bd-1m8k7d)

  Every open engagement costs one `adapter.get/1` call per tick — with no
  guard, a workspace with many open engagements linearly scales forge traffic,
  and once the forge starts returning rate-limit errors, ReviewPatrol kept
  polling at full rate: the retry traffic itself sustained the outage (900
  failed calls in 7 minutes was observed against GitHub's secondary limit).

  `process_engagements_paced/5` now recognizes a rate-limited adapter error
  (a 429, or any error whose `kind` is `:rate_limited` — GitHub sets this for
  both primary quota and secondary/abuse 403s) and counts *consecutive*
  occurrences. Once the count reaches `rate_limit_trip_threshold/1`
  (`config["review_patrol"]["rate_limit_trip_threshold"]`, then
  `:review_patrol_rate_limit_trip_threshold` app env, default 3), the tick
  stops processing the REMAINING engagements immediately — bounding the
  request burst to the threshold regardless of how many engagements are open —
  and the whole patrol (every engagement in this workspace/repo) is paused
  until a computed `paused_until`:

    * When the triggering error carries `retry_after_ms` (from GitHub's
      `Retry-After` or `x-ratelimit-reset` header), that value is honored
      directly — we sleep until the forge itself says the limit clears,
      rather than re-probing.
    * Otherwise we fall back to an exponential backoff
      (`@rate_limit_base_backoff_ms * 2^(backoff_level - 1)`, capped at
      `@rate_limit_max_backoff_ms`) that grows on each successive trip and
      resets once a tick completes without tripping.

  While paused, `do_tick/1` short-circuits before resolving the adapter or
  reading a single engagement — zero forge calls, not even one per
  engagement — and logs (and escalates to the coordinator, exactly once per
  trip) the aggregate deferred count rather than a line per engagement per
  cycle. The pause is workspace/repo-scoped (this GenServer's own state),
  matching where the forge's rate limit itself is scoped: account-wide, not
  per-PR.

  ## Per-engagement circuit breaker on the loop signature (bd-1atwts)

  The review cap above bounds raw re-review *volume*; it says nothing about
  *quality*. An engagement observed in production posted four verdict rounds
  in 2.5 hours on one PR, the last of which re-raised threads the author had
  already refuted in writing — well under the volume cap, but unmistakably a
  loop. This breaker stops posting the moment the **loop signature** itself
  appears, independent of the review cap:

    * **Same-SHA repeat verdict** — we already hold a posted verdict
      (`last_verdict` / `last_verdict_sha`) for the exact commit ReviewPatrol
      is about to verdict again. Checked immediately before any verdict-
      posting call, as a last-resort guard regardless of which path got us
      there.

    * **Disputed re-request** — our standing verdict for this engagement is
      `last_verdict == :request_changes`, the head is UNCHANGED from the
      commit we posted it against (`last_verdict_sha == head_sha`), AND the
      author re-requests review (`review_requested?/2`, the same optional
      capability #1539 uses to override sticky approval) since. No new
      commits means there is nothing new to review — a re-request against a
      standing CHANGES_REQUESTED, with no code change behind it, is the
      author saying our verdict doesn't hold, not asking for a fresh look.
      There is no thread-text classifier here: the triple condition
      (request_changes verdict AND unchanged head AND re-request) is what
      keeps ordinary "please take another look" requests — which normally
      either arrive on a NEW head or follow an APPROVE, where there is
      nothing to dispute — from tripping it.

    * **Answered findings, untouched lines (bd-wtvu9r)** — the issue's second
      named signature, and the actual round-4-of-4 shape of the 2026-09-09
      incident: our standing verdict is `request_changes`, every BLOCKING
      (`severity: :error`) finding behind it already has an author reply, and
      the push that woke us touches the flagged FILE but not the flagged
      LINES. `gate_on_relevance/5`'s relevance gate is file-level, so a push
      like that gets through it; the line-level test that distinguishes the
      loop lives here, on `ThreadMemory.touched_lines/1` (which lines the
      diff ADDS, context lines excluded) rather than on the diff's file
      headers. Checked in `rereview_unless_looping/7`, i.e. AFTER
      `refresh_thread_memory/4` — the incident's author answered our findings
      and pushed inside the same window, so the refutation state only exists
      in the threads read on that tick — and only for the two DISPATCHING
      automation modes, since `:flag` / `:off` post nothing and so have no
      loop to break.

      "Has an author reply" is a per-finding claim, not a per-engagement mood:
      `ThreadMemory.answered?/2` joins each posted finding's `{file, line}` to
      a settled thread within the same ±5-line anchor window the re-raise
      filter uses, and `ThreadMemory.refutations/2` renders the join —
      finding → thread → the **reply id(s)** that answered it — into the trip
      reason, which the escalation quotes. One unanswered blocking finding is
      enough to keep the round running; unanswered *non-blocking* findings are
      not part of the signature (a nit never justified `request_changes`).
      An engagement with no blocking findings at all never trips this arm —
      `Enum.all?/2` over an empty list is vacuously true, which would
      otherwise trip every quiet engagement.

  Each is evaluated only for its own signature; a normal follow-up re-review
  triggered by a fresh push is untouched and keeps running automatically, per
  the guards above (debounce, relevance, sticky approval, review cap).

  The issue's third named signature — "more than N verdict rounds on the
  engagement regardless of SHA" — is deliberately NOT a third arm here; it is
  the pre-existing `review_capped?/2` / `handle_review_cap/2` path (reusing
  `review.rounds`), which escalates and freezes the engagement the same way
  this breaker does, just via its own `review_cap_escalated` flag rather than
  `circuit_breaker_tripped`.

  Complementary to the answered-findings arm, and not replaced by it:
  bd-cccjtn's thread memory means a round that DOES run can no longer repeat
  the settled findings (the check-runner wrapper drops a re-raise whose
  anchored lines the push didn't touch). The arm is what stops the round from
  being dispatched at all when re-litigation is the only thing it could
  contain.

  On trip: nothing is posted. The would-be verdict is written to
  `Arbiter.Reviews.Record` as `status: :completed_unposted, mode:
  :report_only` (mirroring `ExternalReview`'s own report-only bookkeeping),
  ONE coordinator escalation is raised (`kind: :escalation`, subject `"review
  loop on PR #<n>"`), and `circuit_breaker_tripped` is set — a one-way trip,
  same shape as `review_cap_escalated`: every subsequent tick for this
  engagement is a pure no-op (no adapter calls beyond the merged/closed check)
  until a human clears it via `arb update <engagement-id> --resume-review`,
  which resets both `circuit_breaker_tripped` and `circuit_breaker_reason` in
  one call and (`Issue.Changes.RecordCircuitBreakerClear`) watermarks the
  head we tripped on (`circuit_breaker_sha`, recorded on the trip — the
  answered-findings arm trips at a head PAST `last_verdict_sha`, so the two
  are not interchangeable) into `circuit_breaker_cleared_sha`. Every trip
  predicate below checks that watermark: clearing the flag alone does not un-trip
  anything a caller could observe (the head, `last_verdict`, and
  `last_verdict_sha` are all exactly what they were when the breaker
  tripped), so without the watermark the very next tick would re-trip,
  re-escalate, and write a second `Reviews.Record` — the resume would resume
  nothing. There is no *automatic* resume; adjudicating a review loop is a
  human call by design. Once the author pushes a new commit (or the
  coordinator otherwise moves the engagement forward), the watermark stops
  mattering — it only ever matches one specific already-adjudicated SHA.

  # ---- sticky approval (bd-4po0nv) ---------------------------------------
  #
  # Once the operator identity holds a CURRENT approving review on the PR,
  # ReviewPatrol stops auto-re-reviewing on every push — a colleague iterating
  # on their own PR should not collect a fresh approval from us per commit.
  # Re-review resumes only when the new commits are *invalidating*: they alter
  # non-test, non-doc code (the heuristic below), or the diff is otherwise
  # substantive rather than pure reformatting. A doc-only, test-only,
  # formatting-only, or rebase/merge-only push (no substantive file in the new
  # diff) never trips this — it's declined and the decision is recorded on the
  # engagement so "approval is sticky" reads as a decision, not as ReviewPatrol
  # going quiet/broken.
  #
  # `self_approved?/1` is an OPTIONAL adapter capability (already used by the
  # external-review dispatch guard, bd-7z5pi5) that reports whether the
  # authenticated (fleet) identity currently holds an APPROVED verdict — dup
  # state, dismissals, and superseding CHANGES_REQUESTED reviews are already
  # resolved by the adapter. Adapters without it (or a call that errors) fail
  # OPEN here: sticky approval never applies, so behavior is unchanged from
  # before this feature for those adapters.
  #
  # `review_requested?/1` is a second OPTIONAL adapter capability (bd-8us1cp):
  # an explicit re-request of review from our own identity, made after our
  # approval, is the author saying "the approval does not stand" — the same
  # signal a human "approval is sticky unless a colleague asks" convention
  # keys on. That overrides the doc/test/formatting-only classifier
  # unconditionally, because the classifier is a proxy for "nobody asked us
  # to look again", and here somebody explicitly did. Adapters without the
  # capability (or a call that errors) fail OPEN on the override too: sticky

  # The engagement's automation stance (task B). Re-resolved from the workspace's
  # LIVE `review_automation.repo_overrides[repo_name]` on every tick (bd-3cpcw2):
  # a repo override is author-independent and is checked fresh — never just
  # trusted from `engagement.review_automation` — meaning a repo flipped to
  # `report_only`/`flag` immediately stops an in-flight engagement from
  # auto-posting, instead of only gating NEW dispatches. When no override
  # applies to this repo, we fall back to the mode captured at dispatch time
  # (the `auto_authors`/`default` resolution, which still needs the PR author
  # and isn't re-derived here). A missing/unresolvable value is treated
  # conservatively as `:flag` — matching `ReviewAutomation`'s default — so
  # ReviewPatrol never auto-posts against an engagement that was never opted
  # into automatic re-review.
  #
  # The live override and the stored (dispatch-time) mode can disagree in
  # either direction — e.g. a coordinator can dispatch `worker_review` with an
  # explicit hard `automation: "report_only"` override even on a repo whose
  # `repo_overrides` says `auto` (the explicit dispatch arg wins per
  # `Tools.guard_review_automation/3`), which is stored as `:report_only`
  # on the engagement. We must never let a *more permissive* live override
  # widen that back out to auto-posting — only a downgrade (more restrictive)
  # should take immediate effect. So we take the more restrictive of the two,
  # never the more permissive:
  #
  #   :auto        — re-review AND post to the PR.
  #   :report_only — re-review but post NOTHING; report proposed comments to the
  #                  coordinator to greenlight (infra default, bd-36qzgx).
  #   :flag        — do NOT review; surface new commits / replies as a flag.
  #   :off         — hard opt-out (bd-7opdaf): never dispatch a reviewer at
  #                  all. Same non-dispatching behavior as :flag, but ranked
  #                  MORE restrictive so a repo flipped to :off downgrades an
  #                  in-flight engagement immediately, exactly like the
