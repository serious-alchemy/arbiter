defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.FixPassDispatcher do
  @moduledoc """
  Spawn a short-lived worker to fix a `:ci_failed` PR — diagnose the failing
  checks, fix the root cause, and push back to the **same branch** so CI re-runs
  (#354, Phase 2a).

  Invoked by `Arbiter.Worker.Watchdog` when an approved PR is
  blocked because its required checks are failing. Before this, the Watchdog only
  *escalated* a `:ci_failed` block to the coordinator and parked the PR; the fix-pass
  dispatcher lets the common, mechanically-fixable failures (a broken test, a
  formatting violation, a missing compile fix) unblock themselves.

  ## Job scope

  The worker is given a *narrowly* constrained prompt: read the failing check
  names + log tails (handed to it in the briefing), fix the root cause, commit,
  and push to the existing branch with the existing PR updating in place. It must
  NOT re-implement the change set or open a new PR. When the failure isn't
  something it can fix (an infrastructure/flake failure, or a failure it can't
  reproduce) it escalates via the workspace mailbox rather than thrashing.

  ## Registry slot

  The original work worker is still registered under `task_id` (parked at
  `:awaiting_review`, watched by the Watchdog). The fix-pass worker registers under
  `task_id <> ":fixpass"` so `Worker.start` doesn't collide with it — exactly the
  pattern `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.ConflictResolver` uses for `:conflict`.

  ## Merger/tracker-agnostic

  Like the `ConflictResolver`, this operates on raw git artefacts (a local
  checkout, a branch). The CI signal itself is read one layer up (by the merger
  adapter the Watchdog polls); this module only needs the failing-check briefing.

  ## Behaviour

  `FixPassDispatcher` is a behaviour so the Watchdog accepts a swappable
  implementation (defaults to this module). Tests inject a stub so they don't
  boot a real Claude session or shell out to git.

  cause, commit, push to the SAME branch, exit. It does NOT instruct the worker
  to re-implement the change set or open a new PR. It is told to escalate via the
  mailbox when the failure isn't something it can fix, rather than thrashing.

  Two non-code outs are spelled out (bd-5mzzww): `ci_rerun` for a failure that a
  rebuild would clear — with the granularity trap named explicitly, because
  re-running only the failed jobs reuses the stale upstream artifact that caused
  the failure — and `ci_mark_external` for an "infra, not my diff" verdict, which
  previously had nowhere to go but free-text chat nobody read.

    """
    You are a CI fix-pass worker for task #{task_id}.

    Your branch (#{branch}) has an open, approved PR against #{target}, but it
    cannot merge because its required CI checks are FAILING. Your ONLY job is to
    make those checks pass:

      1. Read the failing checks below and reproduce the failure locally where
         you can (run the failing test / linter / build).
      2. Fix the ROOT CAUSE in the code. Do not paper over a real failure by
         deleting or skipping the test unless the test itself is genuinely wrong.
      3. Commit your fix and push to the SAME branch:
         `git push origin #{branch}` (the existing PR updates in place and CI
         re-runs — do NOT open a new PR).
      4. Exit by printing `arb done` on a line by itself.

    Failing checks:
    #{render_checks(Map.get(context, :checks) || [])}
    #{render_outside_diff(Map.get(context, :outside_diff_files) || [])}
    DO NOT:
      * re-implement the change set,
      * open a new PR,
      * touch files unrelated to the failure,
      * disable or skip the check to make it "pass".

    If the check failed for a reason that is NOT in your diff — a stale build
    artifact, a review app an EARLIER job in the same run deployed, a flaky
    external service — you do not have to change code to clear it. Re-run CI
    with the `ci_rerun` MCP tool, and pick the granularity deliberately:

      * `failed_jobs` re-runs ONLY the failed jobs and REUSES every job that
         already succeeded. If the failing check tests something an earlier job
         in the same run produced (a deployed review app, a built image), this
         re-tests the identical stale input and will fail identically. Never use
         it twice in a row — a repeat of an identical re-run tells you nothing.
      * `all_jobs` re-runs the whole run, REBUILDING the upstream jobs. This is
         the right choice for a stale-artifact failure.
      * `workflow` fires a fresh workflow_dispatch and is the only mode that can
         carry inputs (e.g. `{"force_deploy": "true"}`).

    The default mode, `auto`, picks between them for you; override it only when
    you know something it doesn't.

    Whenever you conclude the failure was a FLAKE — you re-ran the job with NO
    code change and it went green — record that with the `flake_record` MCP tool
    BEFORE you exit: pass `ci_job` (the failing check's name) and `signature` (a
    short, distinctive fragment of the failure — a log line, error message, or
    teardown name), and `test_file`/`test_line` when you can identify the
    specific failing test. This is what lets a flake that keeps recurring across
    fix_passes get counted and surfaced, instead of the conclusion living only in
    this run's closing summary. Do this for every flake conclusion, whether or
    not you also call `ci_rerun` or `ci_mark_external`.

    If you conclude the failure is broken infrastructure repo-wide rather than
    anything about this branch — you have evidence, such as the same check
    failing on unrelated branches today, and nothing in this diff touching the
    failing path — record that verdict with the `ci_mark_external` MCP tool
    (`note:` your evidence, in a sentence or two). That reclassifies the park so
    the coordinator escalation reads "CI is broken repo-wide, not on this
    branch" instead of looking like ordinary broken code, and puts your note in
    front of whoever decides to force-merge. Do this INSTEAD of vanishing with
    the diagnosis in your head.

    If the failure is NOT something you can fix and NOT something the above
    covers — a failure you cannot reproduce or understand — STOP and escalate
    by running:

        arb message coordinator "CI fix-pass on #{task_id} needs human review: <one-line explanation>"

    then print `arb done`. Better a loud escalation than a thrashing fix loop.
