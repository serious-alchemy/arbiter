defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.ReviseDispatcher do
  @moduledoc """
  Dispatch an auto-revise pass on a task's **existing** worktree when a human
  reviewer requests changes (or leaves actionable review comments) on its PR
  (bd-95lsjb).

  Invoked by `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue` when `adapter.get` reports a
  CHANGES_REQUESTED review newer than the last one the queue handled. Before
  this, a CHANGES_REQUESTED review left the item idling at `:awaiting_approval`
  forever — the internal ReviewGate is the only revise loop, and it runs
  *pre-PR*, so human PR-side feedback was wired into nothing. The revise
  dispatcher closes that gap.

  ## Job scope

  This reuses the `arb resume` path (`Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.resume/2`): it
  re-attaches a fresh worker to the task's **preserved worktree** —
  the same branch the PR already tracks — briefed with the reviewer's feedback
  prepended to the standard work prompt. The worker addresses the feedback,
  commits, and pushes to the **same branch**; the existing PR updates in place.

  It must NOT open a new PR (pairs with bd-53xrmi: single canonical PR, the
  worker only pushes). `Dispatch.resume` threads the task's existing `pr_ref`
  through so completion reuses the open PR rather than duplicating it.

  ## Merger/tracker-agnostic

  Like the `ConflictResolver`, this module operates on the task + its preserved
  worktree. It is unaware of GitHub/GitLab — the MergeQueue one layer up reads
  the CHANGES_REQUESTED signal from whichever forge adapter it's wired to and
  passes the rendered feedback down.

  ## Behaviour

  `ReviseDispatcher` is a behaviour so the MergeQueue accepts a swappable
  implementation (defaults to this module). Tests inject a stub so they don't
  boot a real Claude session or shell out to git.

  await re-review). Returns `{:error, reason}` when the worktree can't be
  resumed (e.g. it was cleaned up, or a worker is still actively working the
  task) — the MergeQueue parks the item `:failed` so it doesn't spin.
