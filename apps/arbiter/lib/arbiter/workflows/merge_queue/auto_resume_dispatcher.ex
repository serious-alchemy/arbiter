defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.AutoResumeDispatcher do
  @moduledoc """
  Auto-resume a worker that timed out waiting for its MR to be reviewed
  (bd-8eheb6, #1287).

  `{:awaiting_review_timeout, N}` is not a failure in the usual sense. The
  worker did its work, opened its MR and exited 0; the Watchdog then burned its
  poll budget without the forge producing a terminal outcome and registered that
  timeout as the run's `failure_reason`. The MR is frequently mergeable and
  conflict-free the whole time — the run is *cleanly resumable*, which is why a
  coordinator's remedy has always been a plain `worker_resume`.

  Before this module the Watchdog just left such a worker parked in `:failed`
  and waited for a human to notice (only a `worker_failed` event or the
  dashboard's active-worker count surfaced it). Now it calls `resume/1` here
  instead, so the common case self-heals.

  ## Bounded, not infinite

  Auto-resume is capped (`Watchdog`'s `:max_auto_resumes`, default 3) via a
  per-task attempt counter carried on the worker's `meta`
  (`:awaiting_review_resume_attempts`) and re-stamped on each resumed run by
  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch`. A review that never converges — e.g. the ReviewGate
  INCONCLUSIVE-no-verdict flake — therefore burns a bounded budget and then
  pages the coordinator through `escalate_exhausted/5` rather than looping
  silently forever. That escalation says "auto-resume exhausted after N
  attempts", which is deliberately distinct from a first-time genuine failure:
  the coordinator should not have to re-derive that context via `worker_show`.

  ## Behaviour

  `AutoResumeDispatcher` is a behaviour so the Watchdog accepts a swappable
  implementation (defaults to this module). Tests inject a stub
  (`Arbiter.Test.StubAutoResumeDispatcher`) so they don't boot a real Claude
  session or shell out to git.

  Re-attach a fresh worker to the task's preserved worktree — the programmatic
  equivalent of `worker_resume` / `arb resume`.

  `args.attempt` is the 1-based number of *this* auto-resume; it is threaded
  into the new worker's `meta[:awaiting_review_resume_attempts]` so the next
  Watchdog episode on the same task can tell how much of the budget is left.

  Returns `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.resume/2`'s `{:ok, dispatch_result()}` /
  `{:error, reason}`. A `{:error, _}` (e.g. `:no_outpost` — the worktree was
  cleaned up, so there is nothing to resume) means the Watchdog must fall back
  to escalating rather than assume the task is healing.

  `args.briefing` (P7, bd-60r6wp / #1738) is prepended to the resumed worker's
  git-derived resume context — the same slot `Dispatch.resume/2` gives an
  auto-revise's reviewer feedback. The Watchdog sets it when the resume exists
  only to put an uncovered post-approval head in front of the ReviewGate, so
  the fresh agent hands straight back instead of looking for more work.

  `args.claude_command` is the same test escape hatch the sibling dispatchers
  carry (`ConflictResolver`, `FixPassDispatcher`, `ReviseDispatcher`): an argv
  override so an integration test can drive this real resume against a real
  worktree without spawning a real agent subprocess. Never set in production —
  the Watchdog does not thread it.
  """
  @callback resume(args :: resume_args()) :: {:ok, map()} | {:error, term()}

  @typedoc """
  Why the Watchdog gave up self-healing this task:

    * `:budget_exhausted` — the auto-resume budget is spent (or configured to
      `0`). The headline case.
    * `{:resume_failed, reason}` — an auto-resume was still in budget but could
      not run at all (typically `:no_outpost`: the worktree was cleaned up).
      Distinct because "we tried N times and it didn't stick" and "we could not
      try" call for different coordinator actions.
    * `{:resume_blocked, reason, deferrals}` — bd-di4t6d. The resume was refused
      because another pass on the same task still owned the worker registry slot
      (a `fix_pass` or `conflict` subordinate). That is transient, so the
      Watchdog deferred and retried on its poll interval; after `deferrals`
      retries the blocker was *still* live, which is no longer plausibly
      transient. `reason` carries the blocking registry key.
    * `{:resume_blocker_vanished, reason, deferrals}` — bd-985tkl. Same refusal,
      but the pass named by it is already dead, twice running: nothing can ever
      signal its completion, so no later retry will clear the block. Taken well
      inside the deferral budget rather than sitting out the remaining ticks in
      silence. `reason` carries the blocking registry key.
    * `{:stale_reviewed_sha, reviewed, head}` / `{:stale_reviewed_sha, reviewed,
      head, delta}` — the PR head carries content no review covers and there is
      no path back to review. bd-wjpxok / #26: `delta` (when local git could
      list it) names the unreviewed commits and files, so the page carries what
      the coordinator would otherwise reconstruct by hand.
