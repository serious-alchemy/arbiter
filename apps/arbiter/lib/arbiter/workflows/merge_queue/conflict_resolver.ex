defmodule Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.ConflictResolver do
  @moduledoc """
  Spawn a short-lived worker to rebase a CONFLICTING task branch onto the
  current head of its target branch, resolve conflicts, and force-push.

  Invoked by `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue` when a merge queue item enters the
  CONFLICTING state (the merger reports `mergeable: false` on the PR).
  Before this, the queue froze the item and waited for a human to rebase —
  twice this morning that meant a coordinator page on a dispatcher-task
  collision (#117, #121). The resolver worker exists so that case unblocks
  itself.

  ## Job scope

  The worker is given a *narrowly* constrained prompt (built by
  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.conflict_resolve_briefing/3`): rebase onto the
  current target branch, resolve conflicts honoring the task's original intent,
  run the tests and fix what the rebase broke, push back with
  `--force-with-lease`, and exit. It must NOT re-implement the change set
  or open a new PR. The original PR's history is preserved (force-push to
  the same branch updates the existing PR in place).

  When the conflict is mechanical (parallel edits to non-overlapping
  sections of a structured map like the dispatcher `@known_verbs` /
  command-alias tables) the rebase resolves itself with no semantic
  judgement needed. When the conflict is semantic — two waves both
  rewrote the same predicate or both changed a shared invariant — the
  worker escalates via the workspace mailbox (an `:escalation` to
  `to_ref: "coordinator"`) rather than silently failing.

  ## An ordinary run (bd-741sid)

  The resolver is an ordinary run on its ticket: it registers under the ticket
  id (the single-active-run rule, bd-8tjcms, refuses it while another run is
  working the ticket), takes the ticket back In progress, and is admitted like
  an automatic resume (`Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.PassAdmission`) — a free
  slot, or the scheduler's fast lane until one frees. When it finishes, the
  ticket goes back to Merging.

  ## Merger/tracker-agnostic

  This module operates on raw git artefacts (a local checkout, a branch
  name, a target branch). It is unaware of GitHub/GitLab/etc — those live
  one layer up in the MergeQueue, which detects the CONFLICTING state from
  whichever forge adapter it's wired to. A future merge queue variant that
  speaks GitLab MRs reuses this resolver unchanged.

  ## Behaviour

  `ConflictResolver` is a behaviour so the MergeQueue accepts a swappable
  resolver implementation (defaults to this module). Tests inject a
  noop stub so they do not boot a real Claude session or shell out to
  git.

  Spawn a worker to rebase + resolve + push the task's branch.

  Resolves `branch`, `target_branch`, and `repo_path` from the task +
  workspace when not supplied in `args`. Returns `{:ok, info}` once the
  worker is spawned (the rebase runs asynchronously); the MergeQueue picks
  up the resolution on its next poll when the PR turns mergeable again.

  Before spawning, checks whether the branch has actually diverged from the
  target's current tip (`git merge-base` vs the target's fetched-fresh
  `origin/<target>`). When they're equal there is nothing to rebase — a
  phantom conflict, most likely a stale/still-computing mergeability check
  on the forge side — and this returns `{:ok, :no_op}` without spawning
  anything.

  When the worker cannot be spawned (no local checkout, no branch,
  workspace missing) returns `{:error, reason}`. The MergeQueue's escalation
  path handles that by mailing the coordinator so the task does not sit in
  CONFLICTING limbo.
