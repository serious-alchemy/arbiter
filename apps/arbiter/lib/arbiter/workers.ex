defmodule Arbiter.Workers do
  @moduledoc """
  Ash domain for durable worker run history.

  An active worker is an ephemeral GenServer — once it stops, its state is
  gone. `Arbiter.Workers.Run` is the persistent record of what happened: who
  worked which task, with what output, and how it ended. It survives node
  restarts and powers the "Completed Workers" view.

  See `Arbiter.Workers.Run` for the schema. The worker GenServer writes
  through this domain on init (state `:starting`), on each state change, and
  when the run finishes (`:finished` with an outcome — see
  `Arbiter.Workers.RunState`); writes are best-effort and never crash the
  worker.
