defmodule Arbiter.Messages.Message do
  @moduledoc """
  A single entry in the inter-agent message queue.

  One table holds several kinds, distinguished by `:kind`:

    * `:notification` — broadcast event, no specific recipient (`to_ref` nil).
      Worker completion, progress milestones, system events. Feeds the
      coordinator's live dashboard. Never "consumed" — `read_at`/`cleared_at`
      stay nil (the `cleared_at` scoping validation asserts this, rather than
      leaving it to convention).
    * `:mailbox` — targeted at a specific task (`to_ref`). Requires read
      acknowledgement (`mark_read`).
    * `:direction` — user-authored instruction sent from the LiveView to a
      running worker. A subtype of mailbox; distinguished for display.
    * `:flag` — worker-to-worker signal (e.g. Varek telling Soren the API
      shape changed). A subtype of mailbox.

  The remaining kinds are the **coordinator mailbox family** — addressed reports
  an worker (or the system) sends *up* to the coordinator (`to_ref
  "coordinator"`; the legacy `"admiral"` literal is still accepted during the
  retirement compat window — see `ref_variants/1`), surfaced by `arb inbox` and
  the prime briefing:

    * `:completion` — a directive finished successfully.
    * `:failure` — a directive failed (crash, non-zero exit, aborted run).
    * `:escalation` — needs the coordinator's attention/decision.
    * `:info` — a neutral FYI; the default for `arb msg`.

  `:mailbox`, `:direction`, `:flag`, `:completion`, `:failure`,
  `:escalation`, and `:info` together are the "mailbox family": addressed
  messages that show up in an inbox and are read-acknowledged. The
  `:task_ref` they may carry links the message to the task it concerns (shown
  in brackets in `arb inbox`; `:directive_ref` is the deprecated legacy alias
  during the bd-58vtjk compat window). See `mailbox_kinds/0`.

  ## Mailbox lifecycle (three durable states)

  A mailbox-family row carries two independent timestamps — `read_at` (seen)
  and `cleared_at` (addressed) — so "seen" and "still owes action" stop sharing
  one bit:

    * **unread** — `read_at IS NULL AND cleared_at IS NULL`: not yet seen. The
      pending queue (`inbox/2`); auto → read on any fetch that returns bodies.
    * **outstanding** — `read_at NOT NULL AND cleared_at IS NULL`: seen but
      still owes an action. *The triage queue* (`outstanding/2`). Reading no
      longer empties it, so reading escalations every morning is safe.
    * **cleared** — `cleared_at NOT NULL`: addressed. Set explicitly and
      *softly* (`clear_read/2`, `clear_all/2`, `mark_cleared/1`); the row is
      retained as the durable escalation record. Only `hard_purge/2` destroys.

  ## Per-reader read state (bd-8akewg)

  Those three states are *per reader* on the coordinator mailbox, which is a
  single shared queue: producers write one row addressed to `"coordinator"` and
  every browser-hosted session plus the sessionless coordinator reads it. When
  read/cleared were only the two row timestamps above, the first reader to poll
  consumed everybody else's mail.

  So `inbox/2`, `outstanding/2`, `mark_read/2`, `clear_read/2` and `clear_all/2`
  take a `reader:` option, and the state for that reader lives in
  `Arbiter.Messages.MessageReceipt` — no receipt is the unread state. Two rules
  make the rest of the system hold still:

    * A **session** reader (`session_reader/1`) writes only its own receipt. The
      row's `cleared_at` stays nil, so one session triaging its copy cannot
      re-arm an escalation the `last_escalation/2` dedupe is suppressing.
    * The **sessionless coordinator** reader (`coordinator_reader/0` — the CLI,
      the dashboard drawer, a plain minted token) mirrors its writes onto the
      row *and* reads through it, so the REST listing, `hard_purge/2` and that
      same dedupe behave exactly as they did.

  Omitting `reader:` keeps the original row-level semantics, which is what a
  task mailbox wants: it has exactly one reader.

  A session reader with no receipts is, by definition, unread on *everything*,
  so its unread view is bounded (`unread_floor/2`): everything since the
  session started, **plus** every row that is still globally uncleared. The
  second half is what matters — an escalation raised before the session was
  launched is exactly what that session is usually launched to deal with, and
  the `last_escalation/2` dedupe guarantees it is never re-raised. Only the
  resolved archive is withheld.

  ## PubSub

  On create, the message is broadcast on `"messages:<workspace_id>"` as
  `{:new_message, message}`. The dashboard subscribes per workspace; the
  notification feed and mailbox views update in real time.

  Every message addressed to (`to_ref`) or about (`task_ref`) `ref`, newest
  first — the union `thread/2` does not cover, since a direction sent *to* a
  task carries no `task_ref` of its own.

  Reads through the `:for_task` action. Pure read: viewing a task's messages
  never stamps `read_at`/`cleared_at`. Options: `workspace_id:` to scope to one
  workspace, `limit:` to cap the rows returned.
