defmodule Arbiter.Usage.Budget do
  @moduledoc """
  What a task has spent so far, read against what tasks like it usually cost
  (bd-8j9i9p; design bd-9jj5lf §3 and §7).

  `Arbiter.Usage.Estimate` answers "what should this cost?". This module
  answers the other half — "what has it cost, and is that a lot?" — and
  defines the three states every surface renders off:

  | state | condition | reads as |
  |---|---|---|
  | `:normal` | spend ≤ p75 | nothing; no chip |
  | `:running_high` | p75 < spend ≤ p90 | amber "running high" |
  | `:over_budget` | spend > p90 | red "over budget" |
  | `:no_estimate` | no estimate at all | "no estimate yet" |

  Both boundaries are exclusive on purpose: a task that lands *exactly* on its
  group's p75 is a task that cost what a quarter of its peers cost, which is
  not a finding. Only passing the mark is.

  ## Worker spend only (design §7)

  Every figure here sums `source: :task` rows — worker sessions and their
  review / fix-pass rounds. Coordinator-session spend is metered per session
  and attributable to no task, so it is out of both this number and the
  estimate it is compared against. Surfaces must say "worker spend", not
  "spent", so nobody reads it as the task's all-in cost to the org.

  ## The same hygiene as the estimator

  * **Synthetic ids fold to the base task** — a task's spend is its work
    session plus every `#review` / `#impl2` / `:fixpass` round.
    `base_task_id` carries that link for rows written after migration
    `20260820000000`; older rows are caught by a `<id>#%` prefix match and
    folded with `Arbiter.Usage.Estimate.fold_task_id/1`, which is also what
    rejects a prefix match that folds to somebody else.
  * **Unpriced rows are excluded, not zeroed** — a `cost_usd: nil` row means
    the CLI reported no price, so the total is a floor, not a fiction.

  Unlike the estimator there is no window and no closed-task filter: this is
  one task's own running total, and all of it counts.

  `assess/2`'s epic counterpart: nothing dispatches an epic itself, so its own
  ledger is empty and `Estimate.for_issue/2` would only ever hand it a
  peer-group range built out of costs it has nothing to do with. This instead
  rolls both halves up over the epic's direct children (design bd-9jj5lf, per
  bd-byp30z):

    * **spend** — the epic's own worker spend (almost always none) plus every
      direct child's, across *all* buckets — backlog, ready, running,
      waiting, closed — not just closed ones. One
      `Arbiter.Tasks.EpicRollup.children_with_status/1` call for membership,
      one `spend_by_task/2` read over `[epic.id | child_ids]`.
    * **estimate** — each non-epic child's own `Estimate.for_issue/2` range,
      summed percentile-for-percentile (p25+p25, median+median, …) over one
      shared `Estimate.sample/1`. Sub-epic children are skipped (their peer
      group is the same fiction this function exists to avoid) and so are
      children the estimator has no history for (`:insufficient_data`
      contributes nothing, same as a task-level `estimate: nil`). `nil` when
      no child contributes anything. `basis` is `epic_estimate_basis/0`
      rather than a peer-group basis, and `n` counts contributing children,
      not sample rows.

  One ledger read and one estimator sample cover an N-child epic, same as
  `Estimate.epic_cost_rollup/2`.

  Unlike `assess/2`, this does **not** accept a `:spend` option. `assess/2`'s
  `:spend` lets a caller supply an already-computed *per-issue* total to skip
  a ledger read; here the total is a rollup over the epic plus every direct
  child by definition, so there is no single precomputed number a caller
  could sensibly hand in instead — passing `:spend` is silently ignored
  rather than honoured.

  **The summed range overstates the tails.** The p90 of a sum sits below the
  sum of the children's individual p90s unless every child runs hot at once,
  so `state/2` fires `:running_high` / `:over_budget` later than a "true"
  epic-level p90 would. That is the safer direction to be wrong in — it costs
  a late flag, not a false one — but it does mean the aggregate range reads
  wider than an epic's real spread.

  **This is not `Estimate.epic_cost_rollup/2`'s number.** The COST ROLLUP
  panel's `spent` is closed children only, so its "spent · to go" sentence
  holds together; this `spend` is everything so far, in-flight children
  included, because a header answering "what has this epic cost" should not
  hide money still being spent. The two are expected to disagree on the same
  page — and since the rollup's `to_go` now nets in-flight spend against
  those children's estimates, `spent + to_go` itself understates an epic's
  projected total by whatever in-flight children have already burned.

  `state/2` unchanged: `assess/2`'s per-issue semantics stay on `assess/2`
  and `Arbiter.Usage.BudgetPatrol`, which already passes `:spend` explicitly.
