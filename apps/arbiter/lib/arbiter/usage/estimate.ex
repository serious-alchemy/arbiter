defmodule Arbiter.Usage.Estimate do
  @moduledoc """
  Empirical cost estimates for a task, derived from the usage ledger
  (bd-3j4ch4; design bd-9jj5lf §1, §2, §6, §8).

  There is no model here beyond "what did tasks like this one actually cost?".
  `for_issue/2` sums the ledger per closed task over a rolling window, groups
  the totals by the coarsest key that still has enough history, and reports
  the group's percentile spread. Spread is the point: p90 runs ~2.5× the
  median, so a single number would be a lie and the estimate is always a
  range.

  ## The fallback ladder

  Finest group first, each rung needing `n >= 10` closed tasks:

  | rung | key | `basis` | `fallback_level` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | `(difficulty, issue_type)` | `"difficulty+type"` | `0` |
  | 2 | `(difficulty)` | `"difficulty"` | `1` |
  | 3 | every closed task | `"global"` | `2` |

  Below that, `:insufficient_data` — never an invented number. `repo` is
  deliberately *not* a key: it is null on ~64% of rows, so keying on it would
  fragment every group below the threshold (design §1a). Model tier likewise:
  D0–D3 all route to the same tier today, so splitting on it would only thin
  out D4.

  An unrated task (`difficulty: nil`) borrows D2's numbers — the tier routing
  already treats it as — and says so with `basis: "unrated_as_d2"`, so the
  caller can caveat it rather than presenting a fake "unrated" distribution.

  ## Data hygiene (design §2)

  * **Synthetic ids fold to the base task.** A task's real cost is its work
    session *plus* every review and revise round. `base_task_id` carries that
    link for rows written after migration `20260820000000` (bd-5fhyry); older
    rows only have the suffix on `task_id`, so `fold_task_id/1` strips it.
    Without this, rework reads as a crowd of separate cheap "tasks" and drags
    every percentile down.
  * **Unpriced rows are excluded, not zeroed.** A row with `cost_usd: nil`
    means the CLI reported no cost, not that the session was free. A task
    whose rows are *all* unpriced contributes no data point at all.
  * **Worker spend only** (`source: :task`). Coordinator/terminal sessions are
    metered per session and attributable to no task (design §7).
  * **Closed tasks only** — an open task's total is still moving.
  * **Rolling 60-day window, recency weighted** with a 30-day half-life.
    History includes churn that is actively being fixed; a hard window edge
    would let a bad week drop off a cliff on day 61, so old spend fades
    instead.

  ## Percentile definition

  Nearest-rank over cumulative weight: `p` is the smallest observed cost whose
  running weight share reaches `p`. With equal weights this is the ordinary
  nearest-rank percentile (p50 of ten values is the 5th smallest). No
  interpolation — every reported figure is a cost some real task actually
  incurred, which is the honest thing to show next to "spent so far".

  ## Cost

  Compute-on-read (design §8): one indexed range scan over a 60-day window
  plus one `id in [...]` issue fetch, both in the hundreds of rows. Callers
  estimating many issues at once should build the sample once and pass it as
  `:sample`.

  A cost above its tier's p75 that fits the tier above reads as **possibly

  over-rated**. Only tiers with `n >= #{@min_group_n}` are used, in either

  Re-dispatched tasks (more than one `:work` session — re-slung after a

  inflates cost without saying anything about how hard the task was, and
