defmodule Arbiter.Usage.LiveSpend do
  @moduledoc """
  A task's worker spend **including the pass that is still running**
  (bd-8vnuy3).

  `Arbiter.Usage.Event` writes one row per *finished* session, so the settled
  ledger (`Arbiter.Usage.Budget.settled_by_task/2`) cannot see a pass until it
  ends. A 25-minute review round contributed $0 to its task's total right up to
  the moment it jumped by $3; a runaway pass stuck in one long session is
  invisible for exactly as long as it runs. The Claude CLI appends every turn
  to its session JSONL as it happens, and `Arbiter.Usage.ClaudeSessionFile`
  already knows how to read one (message-id dedupe, `:since` windowing for a
  `--resume`-shared file, rollover guard). This module points it at the
  sessions that are in flight and adds what it finds to the ledger.

  ## What is "in flight"

  A worker whose agent port is open: `agent_live: true` on a
  `Arbiter.Worker.list_children/0` snapshot. **Not** a `Workers.Run` row with
  `completed_at: nil` — that row spans the worker's whole life, including the
  time it sits parked at `awaiting_review` long after its session ended and
  was billed (run `ca240465` on vs-5yjnn6 stayed `running` for an hour after
  its session's ledger row landed). Reading off the run row would re-read a
  settled session for as long as the worker stayed parked.

  ## The key: the live worker's project directory

  For each live worker of the task (the author, a `#review` round, an `#impl`
  round, a `:fixpass` / `:conflict` pass — every id that folds to the task),
  the session files are found by listing

      <meta.config_dir>/projects/<project_slug(meta.cwd)>/*.jsonl

  — the directory the CLI writes *every* session it runs from that cwd into —
  and keeping the files modified since the worker started. Why that is
  complete: every agent session Arbiter spawns for a task is a port owned by a
  `Worker` whose task id folds to it, and that worker records the exact
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and cwd it spawned the CLI under (`meta.config_dir` /
  `meta.cwd`, stamped at spawn time, before any session id exists). Whatever
  session id the CLI ends up writing under — one that never reached
  `worker_runs`, one that rolled over mid-run — its file is in that directory
  and was written after the worker started. Keying off `run.session_id` misses
  those: vs-5yjnn6's review round `1aaccf48` had no `worker_runs` row keyed to
  its session id while it ran, and ran in the *author's* worktree directory.

  Two exclusions keep a shared directory honest. A file whose session id the
  ledger already attributes to a *different* task is never counted. And when
  another task's worker has recorded the same config dir + cwd (a repo used as
  its own worktree), the directory is ambiguous: only the session ids this
  task's own live workers report are read — under-reporting an unattributable
  file beats billing it to the wrong task.

  ## Never counted twice

  A pass's ledger row carries its `session_id` and lands (`occurred_at`) when
  its terminal `result` event arrives — after its last turn. So each file is
  read with `since:` the later of the worker's start and that session's newest
  ledger row: turns already billed are before the cutoff, a `--resume` /
  nudge relaunch's new turns are after it. Ledger rows and cutoffs come from
  the same ledger state, so at the moment a pass ends its cost moves from
  `live_usd` to `settled_usd` — the total does not jump by it twice.

  ## An estimate, not billing

  Claude Code 2.1.270+ writes no `cost-state` record, so a live figure is the
  file's deduped tokens priced by `Arbiter.Usage.ClaudePricing` — the same
  estimator a disk-reconciled ledger row uses, and it matches the CLI's own
  `costUSD` for a single-model session. Surfaces must still render it as an
  in-flight estimate (`live?`), distinct from a settled total.

  ## Degraded and unpriced

    * `degraded?` — a live session could not be read cleanly: the file is
      missing, unreadable, or has a line that is not JSON (torn by a crash, or
      caught mid-write). That session's live share is **withheld**, never
      partially counted, so the figure falls back toward the settled ledger
      and says so. A worker with no recorded config dir / cwd / start time is
      degraded the same way.
    * `unpriced?` — some of the spend has no price: a ledger row with
      `cost_usd: nil`, a live agy/antigravity (or other non-Claude) pass, whose
      cost is `nil` by design (bd-481sz7), or a live session on a model the
      price table does not know. `total_usd` is then a floor — or `nil` when
      nothing at all was priced, which surfaces render as "n/a", never
      `$0.00`.
