defmodule Arbiter.Usage.Event do
  @moduledoc """
  A single agent-session usage row.

  One row per finished Claude session (work worker or ReviewGate reviewer),
  inserted from `Arbiter.Worker` when the session port emits its terminal
  `result` event. The worker captures the structured fields off
  `Arbiter.Worker.ClaudeSession`'s session state — see `usage_summary/1`
  there.

  Multiple rows per task are the point of this table: a re-slung task writes
  a second `:work` row, a ReviewGate review adds a `:review` row, and so the
  spend-on-rework story falls out of `Arbiter.Usage.summarize/1` for free.
  That is keyed on `session_id` being genuinely distinct per pass, which
  holds for Claude but not for agy/Gemini: a worker respawn that resumes the
  SAME agy `session_id` gets a `result` event re-reporting the whole
  session's running total, not a delta. `Arbiter.Worker.record_usage_event/3`
  handles this by refreshing the existing row for a repeated
  `(task_id, session_id)` (the `:refresh_snapshot` action) instead of
  inserting a second one — see bd-28t80i. This refresh is gated to
  non-Claude providers only (a resumed Claude `--resume` launch reports only
  that launch's own usage, not a running total, so it must keep inserting a
  row per launch) and only replaces the stored token/cache/cost fields when
  the new snapshot actually has tokens and is no smaller than what is
  already stored — a token-less or partial snapshot (e.g. a relaunch killed
  before its `result` event) only refreshes bookkeeping fields and leaves
  the real numbers alone.

  ## Step

  `:work` — the worker's own session that produced the diff.
  `:review` — a ReviewGate-spawned reviewer session. `task_id` carries the
              `#review` suffix used by `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate` so the row
              is still attributable to the task being reviewed (drop the
              suffix at read time).
  `:impl` — a ReviewGate-spawned implementer session revising the diff in
            response to review findings. `task_id` carries an `#impl<N>`
            suffix (chained onto the reviewer suffix), stripped the same way.
  `:other` — escape hatch for future non-Claude agents that don't fit the
              author/reviewer/implementer split.

  Every step's `workspace_id` is the *authoring task's* workspace, resolved
  from `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate.base_task_id/1` when the worker's own
  `workspace_id` is nil (deliberately the case for reviewer/implementer
  workers, to suppress notifications and merge-queue pickup for the synthetic
  id). The ledger row still needs the real workspace so
  `Arbiter.Usage.summarize/1` doesn't silently drop review/impl spend.

  ## Source (bd-adyhvn)

  `task_id` is nullable, and `source` says what kind of caller spent the
  tokens:

  | source | `task_id` | who writes it |
  |---|---|---|
  | `:task` | set | `Arbiter.Worker` (work / review / impl), `Arbiter.Reviews.ExternalReview` |
  | `:probe` | nil | historical: `Arbiter.Quota.RefreshProbe` — one `claude --print` per workspace to refresh the quota snapshot, deleted in bd-atyrrq once the quota poll made it unnecessary |
  | `:preflight` | nil as of bd-2jgs2h (2026-09-18) | `Arbiter.Agents.Preflight` via the `CredentialWatchdog`'s task-less periodic probe — the sole live producer. Task-attributed rows predating bd-2jgs2h are historical: a per-dispatch / per-resume auth check used to write them before it was retired (see `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch`'s moduledoc and `docs/quota-and-auth.md`) |
  | `:coordinator_session` | nil | a browser-hosted coordinator session (bd-cyxzvq), attributed by `session_id` |
  | `:terminal_session` | nil | an interactive terminal session, likewise by `session_id` |
  | `:maintenance` | nil | Arbiter's own internal passes (the Loop analysis pass; formerly the synthetic `loop-analyze` task id) |

  A `nil` `task_id` is never a missing value — it means "this spend belongs to
  no task", which is why `Arbiter.Usage.summarize/1` drops those rows from
  `:task` rollups rather than inventing a group for them.

  ## Graceful degradation

  Every cost / token / duration field is optional. A CLI that doesn't return
  structured usage still writes a row with `cost_usd: nil` so the *attempt* is
  visible — we never drop the row just because the numbers are missing.
