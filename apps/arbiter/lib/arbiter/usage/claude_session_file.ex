defmodule Arbiter.Usage.ClaudeSessionFile do
  @moduledoc """
  Read token usage back out of Claude Code's **on-disk session JSONL** — a
  fallback/audit source for the `Arbiter.Usage.Event` ledger.

  ## Why this exists

  The primary usage path is `Arbiter.Worker.record_usage_event/3`, which parses
  the Claude CLI's `--output-format stream-json` stdout for the terminal
  `result` event (already-correct cumulative tokens + cost). That path is
  load-bearing and unchanged.

  But it depends on the process living long enough to emit a clean `result`
  event on stdout. A worker whose agent is **killed / crashes** before that
  terminal event — or a node that dies mid-run — leaves the stdout ledger row
  with no token numbers (or no row at all). The Claude CLI *also* persists every
  turn's usage to a session JSONL on disk that survives regardless of how the
  process died, so we can reconcile the missed usage from there. This module is
  that reader. It is deliberately **Claude-Code-specific** — no multi-provider
  `Provider` behaviour until a second provider actually needs one (bd-au3xrq).

  ## Live reads (bd-8vnuy3)

  The CLI appends to this file *while the session runs*, so it is also the
  only source of a running pass's spend: `Arbiter.Usage.LiveSpend` reads it
  for in-flight sessions and adds the result to the settled ledger. That is
  why `read_totals/2` counts `malformed_lines` — a live reader can catch a
  line half-written, and must be able to tell that from a clean read.

  ## On-disk layout (confirmed against Claude Code 2.1.219)

  The CLI writes one file per session at:

      <config_dir>/projects/<project-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl

  where `config_dir` is the effective `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (workers run with an
  isolated `~/.cache/arbiter/worker-claude`, not the default `~/.claude` — see
  `Arbiter.Agents.Claude.ConfigDir`), and `project-slug` is the worker's cwd
  with **every non-alphanumeric character replaced by `-`** (so `/` and `.` and
  `_` all become `-`; letter case is preserved). Each line is one JSON event;
  `assistant`-type lines carry `message.usage` with the per-turn token buckets.

  Because a session id is a globally-unique UUID, `locate/2` finds the file by
  globbing `projects/*/<session-id>.jsonl` under the config dir — no need to
  reconstruct the slug (though `project_slug/1` is exposed for the exact path).

  ## Streaming duplication (the one gotcha)

  Multiple consecutive `assistant` lines can share an identical `message.id`
  with identical `usage` — these are streaming re-emits of the same turn's
  running snapshot, not incremental deltas. Naively summing every line
  double-counts (~2x). `read_totals/2` dedupes by `message.id`, keep-first,
  before summing — matching the spike's prototype (bd-abog97).

  ## One file, several runs (`--resume`) — use `:since`

  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.resume_session/2` re-spawns with `--resume <sid>`
  (no `--fork-session`), and the CLI **appends to the same `<sid>.jsonl`**. But
  Arbiter opens a *new* `Workers.Run` row for the resumed attempt, so one file
  legitimately spans two (or more) runs — reading the whole file for the child
  run would bill it for every token the parent already spent (observed in the
  production ledger: resumed runs whose parent's file holds ~100x the child's
  own usage).

  So every line carries an ISO8601 `timestamp`, and `read_totals/2` takes a
  `:since` cutoff: only turns at-or-after it are summed. Callers pass the
  *run's* start (`session.started_at` in the worker, `run.started_at` in the
  reconciler), which bounds the read to that run's own turns. A turn first seen
  *before* the cutoff is remembered as already-counted, so a streaming re-emit
  landing after the cutoff can't smuggle the parent's turn back in. Lines with
  no parseable `timestamp` are treated as out-of-window when `:since` is given
  — under-reporting is the safe direction here, double-billing is not.

  `read_steps/2` needs the bound in *both* directions, and takes `:until` as
  well. Tokens are read for the newest run in a chain, where "everything after
  my start" is the right window; steps are backfilled for *every* run in the
  chain, and reading a parent with no upper bound would read past its own
  death and file the child's tool calls under the parent's run id.

  ## Cost — `cost-state` records (bd-be804c)

  The `assistant` lines carry token buckets and no dollar figure, and this
  moduledoc used to stop there ("so a reconciled row records `cost_usd: nil`").
  That was true of `assistant` lines and **false of the file as a whole**: the
  CLI periodically appends its own accounting record,

      {"type":"cost-state","sessionId":"…","totalCostUSD":9.777289,
       "totalAPIDuration":350343,"totalDuration":668525,"startTime":1788556943788,
       "modelUsage":{"claude-opus-5[1m]":{"inputTokens":1048,…,"costUSD":9.777289}},
       "hasUnknownModelCost":false}

  so `read_totals/2` reads `totals.cost_usd` straight off it. **The CLI's number
  is reused verbatim, never recomputed** — it has already applied the
  cache-write/cache-read price split that a local price table would get wrong.

  Three properties of these records drive the arithmetic, all confirmed against
  real files:

    * **No `timestamp` field.** They carry `startTime` (epoch ms, the CLI
      *process* start) instead, which is what `:since` windows them by.
    * **`totalCostUSD` is cumulative within one CLI process, and resets when a
      new process opens the same file** (`--resume`). A real session shows
      `… 47.41 → 6.63 → 121.02 …` — monotone within a `startTime`, restarting
      across one. So the file total is `sum over startTime segments of
      max(totalCostUSD)`: max within a segment absorbs the streaming re-emits
      (consecutive records repeat identical totals), sum across segments keeps a
      resumed process's spend from erasing its parent's.
    * **`modelUsage[model].costUSD`** breaks the same total down per model and is
      summed by the identical rule into `totals.model_costs`.

  ### When there is no `cost-state` at all

  Claude Code **2.1.270 stopped writing `cost-state` records**: the live
  coordinator session carries none where its 2.1.26x predecessor carried 18. A
  file with no in-window record therefore falls back to pricing its own deduped
  token buckets through `Arbiter.Usage.ClaudePricing`, and says so —
  `cost_source: :estimated`, and `cost_note_for/1` returns a note naming the
  estimate. Precedence never changes: the CLI's number when it exists, the
  estimate only when it does not, and `cost_usd: nil` (`cost_source: nil`) when
  the model isn't in the price table either.

  ## Per-day split — `by_day`

  A coordinator session lives for days, so "how much" is only half the answer:
  a row dated at *read* time files a week of spend on one day and falsifies
  `arb usage --by day`. Every counted turn is therefore also bucketed by the
  UTC day of its own `timestamp`, with the file's single authoritative cost
  apportioned across those buckets by what each day's tokens are worth. The
  shares sum back to `cost_usd` — this splits the total, it never recomputes
  it.

  ## Forked / rolled-over sessions — use `:session_id`

  Every line also carries the `sessionId` it was written under. A session that
  rolls over to a **new** id copies the parent's lines into the new
  `<sid>.jsonl`, and those copies keep the *parent's* `sessionId` — so summing
  the new file whole would bill the parent's spend twice. Pass `:session_id` and
  lines stamped with a *different* id are skipped (lines with no `sessionId` at
  all are kept: they can't be attributed elsewhere). The worker path omits the
  option and is unchanged.

  Deduped token totals read off a session JSONL. Every token field is a
  non-negative integer (zero when the session produced no `assistant` usage).
  `model` is the model id seen on the assistant/init lines, or `nil`.
  `skipped_before_since` counts distinct turns excluded by the `:since` cutoff
  (an earlier run's turns in a `--resume`-shared file) — kept for the audit
  trail on the reconciled ledger row.

  `model_costs` / `duration_ms` come off the file's `cost-state` records (see
  the moduledoc) and are `%{}` / `nil` when none is in window.
  `cost_state_count` is how many such records contributed, for the audit trail.

  `cost_usd` is the file's one authoritative dollar figure and `cost_source`
  says where it came from: `:cost_state` (the CLI's own number, reused
  verbatim), `:estimated` (`Arbiter.Usage.ClaudePricing`, for the 2.1.270+
  files that carry no `cost-state`), or `nil` when neither was possible — a
  genuine absence, never a fabricated zero. `cost_note_for/1` turns that into
  the note a ledger row should carry.

  `cache_creation_1h_tokens` is the 1-hour-TTL *subset* of
  `cache_creation_tokens` (read off each turn's `usage.cache_creation`
  breakdown; a turn without one counts as a 5-minute write). It bills at 2×
  input rather than 1.25×, and every Claude Code worker and coordinator turn
  observed writes at the 1h TTL (bd-8vnuy3).

  `malformed_lines` counts non-blank lines that did not decode to a JSON
  object — a torn tail from a crash, or a line still being written. They are
  skipped either way; the count is how a caller that needs a *complete* read
  (the live-spend reader, `Arbiter.Usage.LiveSpend`) tells one from a clean
  file.

  `by_day` splits the counted turns into UTC-day buckets, each with its own
  token buckets, message count, `last_at` (the newest turn timestamp in that
  day) and its apportioned share of `cost_usd`. It is `%{}` for a file whose
  turns carry no parseable timestamp at all.

  Mirrors `read_totals/2`'s parsing discipline:

    * **Keep-first per `tool_use` id**, *not* per `message.id`. The dedupe key
      matters here in a way it does not for tokens: on disk, Claude Code
      writes one line per *content block*, and every block of a turn repeats
      that turn's `message.id` — a `thinking` line, then a `text` line, then
      the `tool_use` line. Keeping only the first line per `message.id` (the
      right rule for `read_totals/2`, where the whole turn is re-emitted)
      therefore throws the tool call away and leaves its result unmatched.
      A `tool_use` id is unique within a session, so keying on it dedupes
      streaming re-emits without discarding split blocks — and keeping the
      *first* sighting is what makes `duration_ms` the real elapsed time
      rather than ~0. Repeated `tool_result`s for an id already resolved are
      likewise ignored.
    * **A `tool_use` with no `tool_result` yields no step.** The session was
      killed mid-call; absent beats a row with invented timing.
    * **Torn/non-JSON lines are skipped**, not fatal.

  ## Options

    * `:since` — a `DateTime` (or ISO8601 string) lower bound, applied to the
      *result* line's timestamp, so a `--resume`-shared file doesn't
      attribute the previous run's tool calls to this one.
    * `:until` — the matching *upper* bound. A `--resume` chain shares one
      file in both directions: reading a parent run without an upper bound
      absorbs every child run's calls that were appended after the parent
      died. Callers pass the run's `completed_at`; a nil one keeps the read
      unbounded above (the run is still open, so there is no later run).

  A step whose result line carries no parseable timestamp is dropped when
  *either* bound is given — the same under-report-rather-than-misattribute
  rule `read_totals/2` uses, since against a bound an undated line is
  ambiguous.
