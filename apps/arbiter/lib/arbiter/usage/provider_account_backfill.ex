defmodule Arbiter.Usage.ProviderAccountBackfill do
  @moduledoc """
  P9 (`docs/provider-account-design.md` §8, bd-al9qqe): one-time backfill of
  `usage_events.provider_account_id` from `workspace_provider_accounts`, run
  from the migration that adds the column
  (`priv/repo/migrations/20260921130000_*.exs`).

  A row is backfilled when it has a `workspace_id` and that workspace has a
  `workspace_provider_accounts` link for the row's `provider`. Everything
  else (no workspace, or a workspace linked to a different/no account for
  that provider) is left `NULL` and counted unresolved — the same shape as
  `Arbiter.Usage.WorkspaceBackfill`.

  ## Known limitation: mid-history account changes

  `workspace_provider_accounts` stores the workspace's **current** account per
  provider, not a history of it. If an operator re-points a workspace at a
  different account (`arb account attach`, or a merge re-pointing the link),
  this backfill has no way to tell which account was current for an *older*
  row — every historical row for that workspace/provider gets stamped with
  whatever account the link points to **now**, including rows that predate
  the change. §8 calls this out explicitly ("exact for any period in which a
  workspace's account for that provider did not change — trivially true
  pre-migration, since accounts did not exist") and does not ask this ticket
  to solve it; `provider_account_backfill_test.exs` documents the limitation
  rather than fixing it.

  Plain SQL rather than Ash/Ecto.Query, for the same reason as
  `Arbiter.Usage.WorkspaceBackfill`: this runs from inside an
  `Ecto.Migration`, where only the repo is guaranteed started.

  `usage_events.provider` stores the agent-type alias a spawn ran under
  (`"anthropic"`, `"openai"`, `"gemini"` — `Arbiter.Quota.provider_code/1`),
  not always the canonical `provider_accounts.provider` code
  (`"claude"`, `"codex"`, `"antigravity"`). The join below matches both the
  literal code and the known aliases so historical alias rows are not left
  unresolved; a `"gemini"` row matches the `antigravity` link (the upstream
  `gemini_cli` code was dropped in bd-ac53wz).
