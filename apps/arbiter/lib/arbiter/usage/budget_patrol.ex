defmodule Arbiter.Usage.BudgetPatrol do
  @moduledoc """
  Walks the open tasks on a timer and pages the coordinator the first time one
  crosses its estimate group's p90 (bd-8j9i9p AC5, operator decision
  2026-09-15).

  The chip on the issue header and the flag on the board are *pull* surfaces:
  they say "this ran over" to whoever happens to look. The operator's decision
  was that an overrun should also *push*, once, so the coordinator can rule on
  whether the behaviour is expected — a D2 that is really a D3 needs a
  re-rating, a worker going in circles needs stopping, and those look identical
  from the number alone.

  ## What it deliberately does not do

  Nothing is stopped, paused or tripped. Cost overrun on its own is not
  evidence of a stuck worker the way repeated review failures are (design
  bd-9jj5lf §3), and conflating the two would kill legitimately-hard tasks. The
  page is the whole intervention.

  ## Once per task

  The dedupe is `Arbiter.Messages.Message.last_with_subject/3` on a subject
  carrying no numbers
  (`Arbiter.Messages.CoordinatorNotifier.budget_exceeded_subject/1`), so it
  holds across ticks *and* across a restart — the state lives in the message
  table, not in this process. A task whose total keeps climbing is not paged
  again: the second page would say exactly what the first said.

  A closed task is never paged, however far over it ran (it is done — that is
  calibration-report material, design §6), and neither is one with no estimate
  at all: `:insufficient_data` has no p90 to be over.

  ## Live spend (bd-8vnuy3)

  The figure assessed is `Arbiter.Usage.LiveSpend`'s: the settled ledger plus
  whatever the task's in-flight passes have spent so far, read off their
  session JSONL. Before this, spend only accrued when a session *ended*, so a
  runaway pass — the case this page exists for — could not trip it until it
  stopped running away. The page says how much of its figure is an in-flight
  estimate. The dedupe is unchanged: one page per task, whatever the figure
  does afterwards.

  ## Configuration

  Via `config :arbiter, :budget_patrol`:

    * `:enabled`     — master switch (default `true`; `false` in test, where
                       tests drive `sweep/1` synchronously instead).
    * `:interval_ms` — sweep interval (default 5 minutes). Now that live
                       spend moves between ticks, the interval is how late a
                       runaway pass gets paged. Re-reading the in-flight
                       session files is not what bounds it: a read is ~7 ms at
                       the p90 worker session file size and ~110 ms for the
                       largest on the host (5.7 MB), and only tasks with a live
                       agent are read at all. The sweep's ledger reads (the
                       settled totals and the estimator sample) are the same
                       per-tick cost they always were — 5 minutes doubles that
                       rate, not more, for half the paging lag.
