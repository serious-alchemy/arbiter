  Reads a workspace's `config["merge"]["strategy"]`, resolves the adapter, and

  The strategy is an atom resolved from the workspace via

  The effective `merge` block for `repo` in `workspace`.

  A workspace can hold several repos (`repo_paths`), and one of them can
  merge differently from the rest, e.g. a remote-less infra repo on `direct`
  while the workspace merges via GitHub. The override lives at
  `config["merge"]["repos"][repo]` and is deep-merged over the workspace-level
  `merge` block, so any field it leaves unset falls back field by field (a
  nested `config` map merges key by key). Mirrors
  `agent.security.repos.<repo>` (`Arbiter.Agents.SecurityPolicy`), and matches
  the override key the way `repo_paths` keys match
  (`Arbiter.Tasks.RepoConfig.find_entry/2`: exact, slug-normalised, then the
  bare name of an `owner/name`).

  The result carries no `"repos"` key. With a `nil` repo it is the raw
  workspace-level block, `"repos"` included, unchanged.

  Every reader of `merge.strategy` / `merge.config` for a specific repo
  resolves through this (or through `scope/2`, `resolve/2`, `for_task/1`), so
  a repo never half-uses the workspace's forge.

  Like `prepare/1`, but also overrides the per-process merger config with a
  repo-specific one, using `repo` (the workspace's `repo_paths` key, e.g.
  `"tonic_device"`) to look up the override.

  For `:github`, overrides `owner`/`repo` from an explicit `"owner/repo"`
  slug — used by `Arbiter.Workflows.PRPatrol` so each per-repo patrol
  instance seeds `list_open/0` with the correct repo, even when the
  workspace's merge config omits `repo` (multi-repo workspace shape where
  repo is derived per-repo from that repo's git remote at open time).

  For `:gitlab`, overrides `project_id` (and any other merge-config key) from
  `config["merge"]["config"]["repos"][repo]` — used when a workspace's repos
  map to different GitLab projects (see `Arbiter.Mergers.Gitlab.Config`
  moduledoc), so the right project is targeted instead of the
  workspace-wide default.

  Callers that run in single-repo / single-GitLab-project workspaces or
  already have the repo set in the workspace config can still use
  `prepare/1` — or pass `nil` as `repo` to this function, which falls back
  to `prepare/1` with no override.

  The workspace is first narrowed to `repo`'s effective merge block
  (`scope/2`), so a per-repo `merge.repos.<repo>` override decides the
  strategy and the adapter config seeded here.

  Calls `adapter.open/4`, retrying when the failure is a 409/422 "an open
  PR/MR already exists for this branch" (bd-636thc).

  `Github.open/4` and `Gitlab.open/4` are each already idempotent on their
  own: a look-before-create check, and (on a 409/422) a single reactive
  fallback lookup that adopts the existing open PR/MR instead of failing
  (bd-8rrn9t / bd-8iad6a). That single-shot lookup can still transiently miss
  a PR that is genuinely open — e.g. right after a burst of review-related
  API traffic — exhausting the adapter's own retry and bubbling a raw
  "already exists" error up to the caller even though the PR is sitting
  right there.

  This wraps a bounded retry *around the whole `open/4` call* (not just the
  lookup inside it), giving the adoption lookup another shot end to end.
  Every caller that can open an MR for a task's own branch (`Worker.safe_open/5`
  and `MergeQueue.open_mr_for/4`) routes through this so none of them bypass
  the adoption logic the other already benefits from.

  Any other error (an unrelated 422, a network failure, …) returns
  immediately on the first attempt — this only retries the specific
  "already exists" case.

  bd-28l6im: the original budget (3 attempts, flat 200ms) still let three
  finalize runs strand in one afternoon (bd-8cn795, bd-7opdaf, bd-2wilou) —
  the GitHub-listing miss window this retries around can outlast ~400ms. The
  cost of retrying longer (a few extra seconds, only on a confirmed
  already-open error) is negligible next to the cost of a false failure
  (stranding approved, mergeable work for a human to merge by hand), so the
  default budget backs off exponentially up to ~8.5s total instead of bailing
  after under half a second.
