defmodule Arbiter.Events do
  @moduledoc """
  PubSub broadcast hooks for the server-push event stream (`GET /events`),
  plus the durable log backing `?since=` replay.

  Fires workspace-scoped `{:event, map}` messages on the `"events:<ws_id>"`
  topic. `ArbiterWeb.Api.EventController` subscribes to this topic and streams
  matching events as newline-delimited JSON to connected coordinators.

  ## Durability

  Every broadcast is first written to `Arbiter.Events.Record` (table
  `events`), then fanned out over PubSub. The inserted row's `seq` — an
  autoincrementing integer — is merged into the broadcast payload as
  `:cursor` before either PubSub send, so live subscribers and replay
  readers agree on the same cursor space. A reconnecting coordinator passes
  the last cursor it saw as `GET /events?since=<cursor>`; the controller
  calls `replay/3` to fill the gap before resuming the live stream — see
  that module for how the two are stitched together without dropping or
  duplicating events.

  Persistence failures are logged at `:error` (not swallowed) so an
  operator notices, but do not raise — every existing caller of
  `broadcast/3` treats it as infallible. The live *broadcast* keeps its
  original swallow-on-failure behavior.

  The insert in `persist/3` is **synchronous** — `broadcast/3` blocks its
  caller on it before either PubSub send. This is a deliberate deviation
  from the async/batched ingestion shape referenced when this was scoped
  (Langfuse's "never silently dropped" pattern): synchronous insert is what
  makes "the cursor is stamped before either PubSub send" true without a
  separate coordination step, which is a real simplification. The tradeoff
  is that every broadcast call now blocks on a write behind SQLite's
  single-writer lock. If this shows up as latency on a hot path, batching
  the insert (buffer + periodic flush, assigning `seq` at flush time) is the
  next step — but it adds a window where a `broadcast/3` caller returns
  before its event is durable.

  `persist/3` also runs on whatever connection/transaction its caller is in.
  Most call sites (see below) call `broadcast/3` from inside an Ash
  `after_action` hook, which runs inside the enclosing action's transaction.
  If that transaction later rolls back, the `events` row it wrote
  disappears — but the PubSub broadcast, which already fired, reached
  subscribers before the rollback could happen. This narrowly violates "every
  broadcast that reaches a subscriber is also persisted" for that one row.
  It's harmless for cursor monotonicity (SQLite's `AUTOINCREMENT` just
  leaves a gap, and every consumer already tolerates gaps in `seq`), so it's
  left as a known, accepted caveat rather than moved to an
  `after_transaction` hook.

  Retention is enforced by `Arbiter.Events.Retention`.

  ## Topic registry

  | Topic           | Fires when                                             |
  |-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
  | `inbox`         | A message arrives in the coordinator's mailbox          |
  | `review_gate`      | A review_gate escalation requires coordinator ruling           |
  | `worker_failed`| A worker stops unexpectedly (status → failed)         |
  | `worker_done`  | A worker completes (status → completed)               |
  | `task_state`    | Any task FSM transition (noisier — opt-in only). Carries `state`, `column`, `attention` and `close_reason`, and the legacy `status` for one release (bd-6fkgvo) |
  | `external_review` | An ExternalReview lifecycle transition (running/completed/failed) |
  | `loop_proposal`  | A loop-engineering proposal is recorded / reinforced / promoted / applied / rejected (opt-in only) |
  | `quota_gate_bypass` | A quota gate is bypassed via explicit override (force_quota) |
  | `slot_cap_override` | A resume of a task that released its slot went over a full concurrency cap via explicit `force` (bd-92mx1m) |
  | `coverage_shadow` | P3 shadow mode: the review-coverage predicate and the `last_reviewed_sha` merge guard were compared on a guarded-merge decision (opt-in only) |

  ## Broadcast hooks

  Called from:
    * `Arbiter.Worker.fail_now/2` and `fail_stopped/2` → `:worker_failed`
    * `Arbiter.Worker.broadcast_done/1` → `:worker_done`
    * `Arbiter.Worker.escalate_review_gate/3` → `:review_gate`
    * `Arbiter.Messages.Message.broadcast_new/1` → `:inbox` (coordinator-addressed only)
    * `Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.broadcast_lifecycle/2` → `:task_state`
    * `Arbiter.Reviews.ExternalReview.create_review_record/2` and
      `complete_review_record/3` → `:external_review`
    * `Arbiter.Loop.record/2`, `apply_pending/2` and `reject_pending/2` →
      `:loop_proposal`
    * `Arbiter.Reviews.CoverageShadow.observe/1` → `:coverage_shadow`
    * `Arbiter.Worker.ResumeSlot.admit/2` → `:slot_cap_override`

  All broadcasts are best-effort: PubSub failures are logged at debug and swallowed.

  Broadcast an event on the workspace's event stream PubSub topic.

  `event_topic` is one of the valid topic strings (e.g. `"worker_failed"`).
  `payload` is merged with `topic` and `at` (ISO-8601 timestamp) before broadcasting.
  Also fans out to the global topic so workspace-agnostic coordinator connections
  receive all events.

  Before broadcasting, the event is persisted as an `Arbiter.Events.Record`
  and the row's `seq` merged in as `:cursor` — this is what `replay/3` uses
  to fill a reconnect gap. A persist failure is logged at `:error` (visible,
  unlike the debug-and-swallow below) but does not stop the broadcast — the
  event just isn't replayable. The live broadcast itself stays best-effort:
