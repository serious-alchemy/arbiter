defmodule Arbiter.Boot.ConfigMigrator do
  @moduledoc """
  Run workspace-config data migrations during application boot, right after the
  schema migrations land.

  ## Why this exists (bd-3pqzsa)

  Ecto migrations move the *schema*. Workspace config lives in a JSON column,
  so a config-key rename is invisible to them — it needs a data migration, and
  until this module there was no boot-time home for one. The `rig_paths` →
  `repo_paths` rename shipped a hand-run `mix arbiter.migrate_rig_paths` task
  and, in the same release (v0.1.56), deleted every fallback read. Any install
  that never ran the task by hand lost *all* repo discovery on upgrade:
  `repo_paths` was absent, `rig_paths` was intact but ignored, every dispatch
  failed with `repo "..." is not configured`, PRPatrol went silent, and
  `arb server doctor` stayed green because nothing validated repo config.

  A migration that only runs when an operator remembers to run it is not a
  migration. This child runs it on every boot of the primary instance, so the
  upgrade itself carries the fix.

  ## Shape

  Mirrors `Arbiter.Boot.Migrator`: a one-shot synchronous worker that returns
  `:ignore`, gated on `Arbiter.SingleInstance.primary?/0` so a duplicate or
  transient boot never races the canonical instance's writes. It is placed
  *after* `Arbiter.Boot.Migrator` in the tree so the schema is already at head.

  It now runs before the patrol and finalizer supervisors exist (bd-2hwm9e), so
  the `:patch_config` after-actions (`ReconcilePatrols`,
  `ReconcileMergedPRFinalizer`) can log "reconcile raised/exited" warnings on a
  boot where a legacy key is actually rewritten. They are harmless: the later
  boot tasks start the patrols from the migrated config.

  Every migration here must be idempotent — it runs on every boot, not once.

  Run the config data migrations if this is the primary instance, otherwise
  skip. Always returns `:ignore` — there is no process to supervise.

  `:primary?` overrides the `Arbiter.SingleInstance.primary?/0` lookup (for
  tests); it is evaluated here at start time, not when the spec is built, so
  `Arbiter.Application.children/1` stays a pure spec builder.

  Unlike `Arbiter.Boot.Migrator`, a failure here does NOT abort the boot: a
  workspace whose config cannot be patched is logged loudly and the server
  still comes up, because a reachable server that reports the problem is more
  useful to an operator than a boot loop. `arb server doctor`'s `repos
  resolved` check is the backstop that keeps the failure visible.

  Migrate every workspace still keyed under the retired `rig_paths` config key.

  For each workspace carrying a `rig_paths` map:

    1. deep-merge `rig_paths` *under* `repo_paths` (existing `repo_paths`
       entries win on key collision — they are presumed more current), then
    2. drop `rig_paths`.

  Returns one `t:result/0` per affected workspace, in read order, and `[]` when
  nothing needs migrating — which is the steady state after the first boot, so
  this is safe to run on every boot.

  A workspace is only a migration candidate when `rig_paths` holds a map; a
  non-map value under either key cannot hold repos and is handled without
  raising (see `current_map/2`), because this runs inside the supervision tree.

  Options:

    * `:apply?` (default `true`) — when `false`, report what would move without
      writing anything. Backs `mix arbiter.migrate_rig_paths`'s dry-run.
