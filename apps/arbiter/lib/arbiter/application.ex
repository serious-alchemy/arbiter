  Build the application's full child spec list.

  `:auto_start?` controls whether the gated boot Tasks (orphan-run
  reconciliation and merge_queue enumeration) are appended. `start/2` mirrors
  `MergeQueueSupervisor.auto_start?()` here — false in `test`, true everywhere
  else — so the boot Tasks don't race the sandboxed DB connection.

  This is a pure function (it builds specs, it starts nothing) so a test can
  resolve the *full* boot wiring with `auto_start?: true` and assert every
  child id is unique. That guard matters because the boot Tasks are gated off
  in test: a duplicate child id between them is otherwise invisible to the
  green suite and only surfaces as a real dev/prod boot crash ("more than one
  child specification has the id: Task"). See `Arbiter.ApplicationTest`.

  #
  #   * SingleInstance: hold a session advisory lock that identifies the one
  #     canonical instance per DB. Started FIRST (and synchronously, via its
  #     init) so the migrator and reconcile Task below can read its verdict.
  #     See bd-9rouwh.
  #   * migrator: run pending Ecto migrations to head, SYNCHRONOUSLY, before any
  #     later child (or the :arbiter_web endpoint) comes up against a stale
  #     schema. Gated on the SingleInstance primary verdict so only the one
  #     canonical instance migrates. A migration failure aborts the boot. Placed
  #     before reconcile/merge_queue so those run against the current schema. It is
  #     a one-shot worker (returns :ignore), not a Task, precisely so it BLOCKS
  #     the boot until the schema is current. See Arbiter.Boot.Migrator.
  #   * config_migrator: run workspace-config DATA migrations (config lives in a
  #     JSON column, so Ecto migrations never touch it) once the schema is at
  #     head — currently the retired `rig_paths` -> `repo_paths` key rename.
  #     Same primary-instance gate and same synchronous one-shot shape as the
  #     migrator, and placed right after it so every later child (patrols,
  #     queues) enumerates workspaces whose repo config is already current.
  #     See Arbiter.Boot.ConfigMigrator and bd-3pqzsa.
  #   * provider_accounts: classify the install from the migration state —
  #     fresh, migrated, or un-migrated with legacy credentials (a boot
  #     warning naming them; accounts are always on since P13, bd-9gqj8e) —
  #     and, on a fresh primary, join each workspace to `<provider>:default`.
  #     Synchronous and after the migrators, so every later child dispatches
  #     against the joins. See Arbiter.Accounts.Enablement and bd-cvvb02.
  #   * reconcile: sweep orphaned :running worker_runs left behind by a node
  #     that died mid-run. Runs once after Repo + Worker.Registry are online —
  #     but ONLY on the primary instance, so a transient/duplicate boot can't
  #     fail the live instance's running runs.
  #   * reconcile_shutdown_casualties: re-stamp runs the previous node's stop
  #     failed :machine_died as :interrupted, so the resume sweep below picks
  #     them up with their slot held (bd-146u20 / #2053).
  #   * reconcile_open_prs: find in-progress tickets with a PR but no live
  #     worker. Restarts the Watchdog of each Merging one from its row
  #     (bd-741sid) and hands the rest to the patrols.
  #     Escalates each to the coordinator only when neither can watch it.
  #     bd-crqku8.
  #   * resume gate (bd-35gvrj): holds Autopilot's dispatching until the
  #     reconcile task above has re-registered the resumed runs; the account
  #     concurrency cap is counted from the live registry, which is empty at
  #     boot. See Arbiter.Boot.ResumeGate.
  #   * session_adoption: reconcile the `sessions` table against the coordinator
  #     sessions systemd and tmux still have running (bd-bpt0ag, RFC §4.6). This
  #     is the ONLY thing that reconnects Arbiter to a session after a restart —
  #     nothing in the BEAM holds a handle to one, by design — so it doubles as
  #     the reattach path and as orphan detection. Primary-gated: a duplicate
  #     boot must not mark the live instance's sessions ended. It never kills an
  #     unrecognised live scope; see Arbiter.Sessions.Adoption.
  #   * review_checkout_sweep: remove in-gate reviewer checkouts a ReviewGate
  #     left behind because the previous node died under it (its `terminate/2`
  #     never ran). Primary-gated for the same reason as reconcile: a duplicate
  #     boot must not delete the live instance's checkouts. Only leaves older
  #     than this VM are touched, so a gate that starts while the sweep runs is
  #     safe. See Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate.sweep_orphaned_review_checkouts/1
  #     and bd-a22hib.
  #   * merge_queue: eagerly start one MergeQueue per existing workspace once the
  #     tree is up, so a cold boot misses no `:worker_done` events.
  #
  # Gated off in test (auto_start?/0 is false) so the boot sweep doesn't race
  # the sandboxed connection and test code can drive the GenServers with its
  # own stubs. That gating is exactly why an id collision here is invisible to
  # the suite — `Arbiter.ApplicationTest` forces `auto_start?: true` to close
  # the gap.
