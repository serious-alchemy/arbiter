defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.Claim do
  @moduledoc """
  Bridges tracker issues ↔ tasks via the "claim then task" model.

  Tracker issues are the shared backlog; *assignment is the claim*. A task is
  created only for an issue assigned to the workspace's authenticated user — so
  the fleet never tasks work someone else owns.

  Generalised over the `Tracker` behaviour: works with any adapter that
  implements `current_user/0` (GitHub, Jira, Shortcut). Trackers that return
  `{:error, :not_supported}` from `current_user/0` (e.g. `None`) degrade
  cleanly: `claim/3` returns `{:error, :tracker_not_supported}` and `plan/1`
  returns `{:ok, []}`.

  Two operations:

    * `claim/3` — fetch one issue by ref and create a linked task (idempotent).
    * `plan/1` + `apply_plan/3` — reconcile assigned-to-viewer open issues
      against open tasks, in both directions.

  Claim a tracker issue: fetch it via the workspace adapter, refuse unless it
  is assigned to the workspace's authenticated user (overridable with
  `force: true`), and create a task linked by `tracker_ref`. Idempotent:
  returns the existing task if one already references the issue.

  For adapters that implement the optional `check_prior_claim/1` callback
  (currently GitHub), also checks for an existing ownership comment and refuses
  if another Arbiter installation has already claimed the issue.

  For adapters that implement the optional `signal_claim/3` callback (currently
  GitHub), posts an ownership comment and assigns the issue to the viewer after
  creating the task. These side-effects are non-fatal.

  Derives `priority`, `difficulty` and `issue_type` from the issue via the
  adapter's optional `extract_priority/1` / `extract_difficulty/1` /
  `extract_issue_type/1` callbacks (currently: GitHub label parsing).
  `:difficulty` and `:repo` opts below, when given, override whatever the
  adapter derived — an explicit caller value always wins.

  Options:

    * `:force` — when `true`, skip both the assignment check and the prior
      claim check.
    * `:difficulty` — explicit 0..5 difficulty, overriding any value derived
      from the issue's labels. `nil`/omitted leaves the derived value (or
      the schema's nil, which routing treats as D2) in place.
    * `:repo` — persists the task's `repo` (a `repo_paths` key), overriding
      any adapter-derived value. Unlike `difficulty`/`priority` there is no
      adapter-side derivation for `repo` today, so this is effectively the
      only way to set it at claim time.

  Returns:

    * `{:ok, :created, %Issue{}}` — a new task was inserted.
    * `{:ok, :existing, %Issue{}}` — a task for this ref already existed.
    * `{:error, :tracker_not_supported}` — the workspace's tracker does not
      support the claim operation (e.g. `none`).
    * `{:error, {:not_assigned, identity}}` — the issue isn't assigned to the
      workspace's authenticated user.
    * `{:error, {:already_claimed, body}}` — another Arbiter installation has
      already claimed this issue (override with `force: true`).
    * `{:error, term}` — surfaced from the tracker adapter or Ash.

      somebody other than the viewer → `{:close, task_id, reason}`. An issue
      that is merely *unassigned*, or that can't be fetched, yields no action

  #
  # Two shapes are exempt outright:
  #
  #   * `:task`-type — the opt-in non-reviewable research/investigation type
  #     (see `Issue.issue_type`). Its deliverable is a findings summary in
  #     `notes`: no diff, no PR. Closing one records that the *investigation*
  #     finished, not that the underlying work is done.
  #   * `review_only` — a borrowed ticket this task never owned. SyncTracker
  #     refuses to transition it (bd-6xaaam), so it is open by construction.
  #
  # Past that, bd-83ojwi asked whether the close shipped a diff, using `pr_ref`
  # as the stand-in. bd-bsco7f keeps that limb and adds the signal it was
  # standing in for. `close_upstream_expected` (recorded at close time by
  # `Issue.Changes.RecordCloseIntent`) says outright whether the close was meant
  # to propagate, which catches the case `pr_ref` cannot see: a `bug` fixed by
  # hand or as a drive-by, closed with `close_upstream: true`, whose upstream
  # close then failed. No PR was ever opened, so bd-83ojwi's gate read it as a
  # findings-only close and said nothing — the bd-2wilou class arriving by the
  # manual path.
  #
  # Both limbs are needed, and neither subsumes the other:
  #
  #   * intent alone would drop the Jira merge path, which closes with
  #     `close_upstream: false` on purpose (the `:merged` lifecycle already
  #     moved the ticket to Code Complete — see `MergeQueue.close_task_and_finalize`)
  #     yet very much expects the ticket not to be left open.
  #   * `pr_ref` alone is bd-83ojwi's blind spot, and it is the only signal
  #     available for rows closed before the intent was recorded (`nil`), where
  #     it stays the fallback. That is what keeps the live findings-only closes
