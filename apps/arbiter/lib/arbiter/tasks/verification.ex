defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.Verification do
  @moduledoc """
  Post-merge verification (bd-9so315) — the `:verifying` half of the ticket
  lifecycle.

  ## Why this exists

  The largest escaped-defect class in the 2026-09-13 follow-up-rate
  investigation was changes whose only execution context is the long-lived
  server: `capture_source` reading a deleted key, `doctor` staying green while
  repo discovery returned zero repos, env/config plumbing that reached no
  worker, shipped dead code. All merged green, all auto-closed by the merge
  queue, all found broken a median ~8 hours later. Nothing in the pipeline ever
  asked "is this live and working?" — and a single observation after a restart
  would have caught every one of them.

  So a task flagged `verify_after_deploy: true` does not close on merge. It
  parks at `:verifying` (attention cause `:awaiting_verification`), the
  coordinator is notified (with whether the running server predates the merge,
  i.e. whether a restart is needed first), and the task leaves the state only
  through a recorded verdict:

      Verification.observed(task, "restarted; /api/doctor now reports 3 repos")
      Verification.failed(task, "after restart capture_source still reads headers")

  ## Upstream tracker close: at merge, not deferred

  The upstream issue is closed at **merge** time, exactly as before the flag
  existed, for both flagged and unflagged tasks. Deferring it would be a
  fiction: the PR body carries a `Closes #N` keyword, so GitHub closes the
  upstream issue the moment the PR merges whatever Arbiter does, and a local
  record claiming the upstream is still open is precisely the drift
  `Arbiter.Tasks.Claim`'s check exists to catch. `failed/2` reopens the
  upstream issue along with the task (the `:reopen` action's own
  `SyncTracker`), so the two stay consistent through a failed round too.

  ## Evidence is persisted before the transition

  `record_verification` (evidence + verdict) runs as its own action *before*
  the `:close` / `:reopen`, so a failure in the follow-on transition still
  leaves the evidence durable on the task rather than losing what was observed.

  Reopening (rather than filing a linked bug) keeps the original ticket — and
  its acceptance criteria — as the single place the fix is tracked, and the
  `:reopen` action already clears `pr_ref`/`source_pr` so the retry opens a
  fresh PR instead of re-finalizing the merged one. `verify_after_deploy`
  survives, so the retry re-enters verification when it merges.

  The single merge-success funnel: close the task, or — when it carries
  `verify_after_deploy: true` — park it at `:verifying` and notify the
  coordinator exactly once.

  Every path that finalizes a merged PR routes through here — the merge queue's
  own merge, `MergedPRFinalizer`'s sweep for a PR merged outside the queue, and
  `Arbiter.Worker.Driver`'s close of a worker the Watchdog completed with
  `:merged` — so the flag cannot be honoured on one path and silently ignored
  on another.

  Options:

    * `:close_upstream` (default `true`) — propagate the close to the linked
      tracker. Applies to BOTH branches: the upstream close is not deferred by
      verification (see the moduledoc).
    * `:mr_ref` — the PR/MR ref to name in the escalation; falls back to the
      task's `pr_ref`.
    * `:merged_at` (default now) — when the merge landed, compared against the
      running node's boot time to say whether a restart is needed first.

  Returns `{:ok, :closed | :awaiting_verification, issue}` or `{:error, reason}`
  — `:awaiting_verification` names the outcome (the ticket's attention cause);
  the ticket itself is then `state: :verifying`.
