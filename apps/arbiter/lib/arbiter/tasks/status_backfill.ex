defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.StatusBackfill do
  @moduledoc """
  Reconcile task lifecycle states in the database against git history on a
  branch.

  The cutover postmortem flagged that task statuses in the original Dolt
  source drifted out of sync during late-Phase implementation: the coordinator
  stopped closing tasks in Dolt once dogfood-switchover happened, so the
  `--sync-status` importer carried the stale open statuses forward.

  This module reads `git log` for `feat(<task-id>)` commit subjects on a
  configured branch (default `main`) and treats those as evidence the
  task shipped. Any task with such a commit whose current `state` isn't
  `:closed` gets a proposal to close. `apply!/1` performs the closures.

  ## What counts as evidence

  Only the `feat(<id>)` prefix is honored. `docs(<id>)`, `fix(<id>)`, and
  `test(<id>)` are intentionally skipped — those signal "work touched the
  task" but not "the task shipped". A task with only docs/fix/test
  commits and no feat is left untouched.

  ## What this does NOT do

  - Detect reverts. If a `feat(<id>)` commit was reverted, the task would
    still be proposed for closure. Operator inspection of the proposals
    list is the safety net for this.
  - Reopen tasks. The reconciliation is one-directional (not closed → closed).
    A task that's `:closed` in the database but has no `feat(<id>)` commit
    is left closed.
