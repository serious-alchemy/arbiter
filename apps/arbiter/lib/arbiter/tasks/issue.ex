defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.Issue do
  @moduledoc """
  An Issue is a unit of work in the task ledger. Equivalent to a bd "task" in the
  Go implementation: title, description, status, priority, dependencies, audit trail,
  optional external-tracker reference.

  IDs are human-friendly strings: `"{workspace.prefix}-{short_id}"`, e.g. `"bd-3o8"`,
  `"apex-AX17575"`. The short_id is a 6-char base36 random; collisions are
  negligible at our scale.

  ## Lifecycle state (bd-842qio)

  `state` is the ticket's one stored lifecycle state —
  `backlog | queued | active | merging | verifying | closed` — and only the
  named transition actions move it: `:promote`, `:demote`, `:start`,
  `:open_pr`, `:return_to_work`, `:await_verification`, `:close`, `:reopen`.
  The table lives in `Arbiter.Tasks.Lifecycle`; the model in
  `docs/design/ticket-lifecycle.md`. The legacy doors `:promote_to_ready` and
  `:return_to_backlog` apply `promote` / `demote`.

  Until the later lifecycle children switch every consumer to `state`, each
  transition also dual-writes the legacy `status` and `refined` columns below,
  and a legacy `status` write through `:update` re-derives `state`
  (`Changes.FollowLegacyStatus`), so the two never disagree.

  ## Status FSM (legacy)

      :open ⇄ :in_progress
       │          │
       │          ├────► :awaiting_verification ─┬─► :closed
       │          │                              └─► reopen → :open
       └────►─────┴────► :closed
                          │
                          └ reopen → :open

  Enforced in `:update`, `:await_verification`, `:close`, `:reopen` actions. You
  cannot close an already closed issue, and cannot transition out of :closed
  without an explicit `:reopen`. The lifecycle table is stricter where the two
  differ (a ticket enters `:verifying` only from `:active` or `:merging`).

  ## Post-merge verification (bd-9so315)

  A task flagged `verify_after_deploy: true` is one whose only execution context
  is the long-lived server — env/config plumbing, a doctor probe, a capture
  path. Merging it proves nothing: the running server still holds the old code.
  For those, the merge parks the task at `:awaiting_verification` (via
  `:await_verification`) instead of closing it, and the coordinator records a
  restart-and-observe result through `Arbiter.Tasks.Verification`:

    * `observed/2` → `verification_outcome: :observed` + evidence, then `:close`.
    * `failed/2`   → `verification_outcome: :failed` + evidence, then `:reopen`.

  The upstream tracker close is **not** deferred: it still happens at merge
  time, because the PR body's `Closes #N` keyword closes the upstream issue on
  merge regardless of what Arbiter does, and leaving the local record claiming
  otherwise is exactly the drift `Tasks.Claim`'s check exists to catch. A
  `failed/2` verification reopens the upstream issue along with the task.

  ## Rich-content fields

  All Markdown: `description`, `acceptance`, `notes`, `qa_notes`, `deployment_notes`.
  Stored verbatim. Adapters (Tracker.Jira etc., gte-029) convert to the external
  format (ADF for Jira, native Markdown for Linear/GitHub) at write-time.

  ## External tracker

  `tracker_type` defaults to the workspace's tracker.type (from `Workspace.config`),
  falling back to `:none` if the workspace doesn't specify one. Override per-task by
  passing `tracker_type:` to the create action.

  A task created with a `parent_id` whose parent is tracker-linked defaults from
  the parent instead (#1973), per the workspace's `tracker.child_policy`: by
  default it stays local (`tracker_type: :none`) and copies the parent's ticket
  into `tracker_context_type`/`tracker_context_ref`, so no ticket is minted. See
  `Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.Changes.InheritTrackerType`.

  The ticket key a task's branch name and conventional-commit PR title carry is
  `tracker_ref` when set, else `tracker_context_ref` (see
  `Arbiter.Worker.BranchNamer` and `Arbiter.Mergers.PRTitle`).

  ## Audit

  Via `AshPaperTrail.Resource` extension. Every create / update / close / reopen
  produces a paper-trail version row capturing the diff + actor.

  Returns the "ready" tickets: exactly those whose `Arbiter.Tasks.Lifecycle.view/2`
  column is `:ready` (bd-6zapbl) — `:queued`, with every gating blocker
  satisfied (`:verifying` or `:closed`, per `Lifecycle.blocker_satisfied?/1`).

  So a `:backlog` ticket is never ready, whatever its edges: it has not been
  refined into the queue. And a blocker that has merged and is waiting on its
  post-merge verification no longer holds its dependents back.

  Informational dep types (`:relates_to`, `:discovered_from`, `:parent_of`) do
  NOT gate readiness — only `:blocks` and `:depends_on` count, through
  `Arbiter.Tasks.EdgeGate.blockers/2`, the same computation the board's
  Ready/Blocked split reads. Epics (`non_dispatchable_types/0`) are excluded
  up front: an epic is a rollup of children, never a unit of work.

  This is the read behind the `task_ready` MCP tool, `GET /api/issues/ready`,
  `arb ready` and `arb prime`'s "Ready issues". It passes no runs to the
  projection: a `:queued` ticket whose run registered before dispatch's
  `start` transition landed still reads as ready here, for that window.
