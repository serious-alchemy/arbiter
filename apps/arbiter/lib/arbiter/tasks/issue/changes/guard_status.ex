defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.Changes.GuardStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  Enforces the Issue status FSM:

      :open ⇄ :in_progress
       │          │
       │          ├────► :awaiting_verification ─┬─► :closed
       │          │                              └─► reopen → :open
       └────►─────┴────► :closed
                          │
                          └ reopen → :open

  Rules by action:

  * `:update` — caller may change status open ⇄ in_progress only. Transitioning
    to or from `:closed` / `:awaiting_verification` requires the `:close` /
    `:reopen` / `:await_verification` actions explicitly.
  * `:await_verification` (bd-9so315) — current status must be `:open` or
    `:in_progress`. A closed task has nothing left to verify, and re-entering
    the state from itself would reset the clock the coordinator is watching.
  * `:record_verification` (bd-9so315) — current status must be
    `:awaiting_verification`; there is no verdict to record otherwise.
  * `:close` — current status must be `:open`, `:in_progress` or
    `:awaiting_verification`. Cannot close an already-closed issue (silent
    no-op would mask bugs).
  * `:reopen` — current status must be `:closed` or `:awaiting_verification`
    (a failed verification sends the task back for another attempt).
  * `:sync_upstream_close` — current status must already be `:closed`. Makes no
    local status/closed_at change; only pushes a close to the linked tracker
    for a task that closed without `close_upstream: true` at the time.
