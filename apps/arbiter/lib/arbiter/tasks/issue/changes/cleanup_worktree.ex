defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.Changes.CleanupWorktree do
  @moduledoc """
  After-action hook for the `:close` action: if a git worktree exists for
  this task, remove it.

  Path is derived from the task via `Arbiter.Worker.BranchNamer.derive/1`
  + `Arbiter.Worker.Worktree.worktree_path/1` — the same convention
  `Dispatch` uses on provisioning, so we never need a stored path.

  Two paths are reclaimed, both derived from the same branch name:

    * the **branch** worktree (`Worktree.worktree_path/1`) — a code dispatch's
      checkout, which may hold uncommitted or unpushed work, so removal is
      skipped when it is dirty;
    * the **inspect** worktree (`Worktree.inspect_path/1`, bd-9r1tta) — the
      detached checkout a `task`-type audit/spike runs in. Nothing there is
      meant to be preserved (no branch, so nothing unpushed; the agent's
      deliverable is `notes`), so it is removed even when dirty. Leaving it
      would leak a worktree per audited task, which is the cost of giving the
      inspect checkout its own leaf.

  Best-effort. Skipped silently when:

    * no directory exists at the derived path,
    * the branch worktree has uncommitted changes (a warning is logged so the
      operator notices a manual cleanup is needed),
    * `BranchNamer.derive/1` cannot produce a branch (e.g. legacy tasks
      with unrecognised issue types).

  Liveness guard (bd-bmmj4w): git status alone cannot prove a worktree is
  safe to delete — a clean, fully-pushed worktree can still have a live
  sub-worker (a `#review` round, a fix pass, ...) mid-`mix test` inside it, and
  removing it then destroys the directory out from under a running process.

  The guard has two halves, and it is the pair that makes it sound:

    * `Worker.terminate/2` SIGKILLs the agent's OS process **and its
      descendants** before the worker GenServer finishes dying. Erlang does
      not reap a `:spawn_executable` port's OS process on owner death, so
      without that half a stopped worker still leaves a live `claude` (and
      its `mix test` child) running in the worktree, and no registry check
      could see it.
    * This hook then waits (briefly) for every worker registered under this
      task to actually leave the registry, because `StopWorker` — which runs
      immediately before it — uses a *bounded* per-worker stop and may return
      while a worker is still mid-`terminate/2`. If any is still alive when
      the grace window closes, both removals are skipped with a warning, same
      as the dirty path.

  So what this hook checks directly is "no worker GenServer for this task is
  still registered and alive"; that stands in for "no agent still owns the
  directory" only because of the first half above. It is not a general
  live-process probe of the directory, and two residual cases stay invisible
  to it:

    * a process that never belonged to a worker at all — an operator's own
      shell sitting in the worktree, say;
    * an *orphaned* agent, whose worker died without `terminate/2` running
      (`Process.exit(pid, :kill)`, or a teardown that overran its shutdown
      grace and was killed — `Worker` traps every other exit since
      bd-aje6fj). Nothing killed its OS process, and the registry row for the
      dead worker is filtered out by `live_for/1` as a corpse, so the drain
      reports `:drained` while the agent is still running in the directory.
      Every path that stops a worker deliberately (`Worker.stop/3`, and so
      `StopWorker`) goes through `GenServer.stop`, which always runs
      `terminate/2` — so this is the abnormal-kill case, not the `:close`
      path the incident came from. Closing it would take an OS-level probe
      of the directory (`/proc/*/cwd`, `lsof`), which is platform-specific;
      it is deliberately out of scope here.

  Failures from `Worktree.cleanup/1` are logged but never propagated — the
  `:close` action must succeed even if teardown does not.

  Pairs with `Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.Changes.StopWorker`, which handles the
  in-memory side of teardown.
