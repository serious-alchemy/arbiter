defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.Changes.CreateUpstream do
  @moduledoc """
  After-transaction hook for `Issue.create`: when the task has a tracker
  configured, mirror it into the upstream tracker and persist the returned
  ref back into `tracker_ref`.

  Skipped (no upstream call) when **any** of these hold:

    * `tracker_type == :none` — the workspace has no tracker.
    * `tracker_ref` was supplied — the caller is binding to an existing
      upstream issue (`arb create --tracker-ref N`), not creating a new one.
    * the `:skip_upstream_create` argument is `true` — explicit opt-out
      (`arb create --no-tracker`).

  Runs in an `after_transaction` hook (not `after_action`) so the task is
  **committed before** the upstream call. That preserves the task even when
  the upstream create fails, mirroring the `--deps` failure semantics in
  `ArbiterCli.Cmd.Create`: the local resource is durable, the failure is
  surfaced to the caller, and a follow-up `arb update --tracker-ref` can
  re-link the task without orphaning anything.

  On a successful upstream create the returned ref is persisted to the task
  via a second `Ash.update` (the after-transaction phase has already
  committed, so we're outside the original transaction). On failure the
  hook returns `{:ok, issue}` *but* stashes a structured error in the
  per-process slot returned by `last_error/0` — the task is durable, the
  action result is success, and the controller picks the stash up after
  `Ash.create` returns and renders the 502 + task body that lets the CLI
  exit non-zero with a useful message.

  We use a process-dict side channel rather than `{:error, term}` because
  Ash wraps unrecognised error terms in `Ash.Error.Unknown.UnknownError`,
  which mangles the shape into a string and discards the kind/task_id
  fields the controller needs to render a structured 502 response.
