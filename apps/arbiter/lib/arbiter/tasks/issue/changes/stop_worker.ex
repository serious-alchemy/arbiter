defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.Changes.StopWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  After-action hook for the `:close` action: stop every process registered
  under this task — its run, the ReviewGate sessions (`<task_id>#review`, ...)
  and its Watchdog (`<task_id>:watchdog`) — except the caller itself.

  Best-effort: when no worker is running, silently skip. Any failure to
  stop a worker is logged but never propagated — the `:close` action must
  succeed even if teardown does not.

  Stopping a worker also kills its agent's OS process tree, synchronously,
  inside `Worker.terminate/2` (bd-bmmj4w) — so when this hook's stop returns
  `:ok` the agent is provably no longer running in the task's worktree, which
  is the precondition `CleanupWorktree` relies on before removing it.

  Pairs with `Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.Changes.CleanupWorktree`, which handles
  the on-disk side of teardown.
