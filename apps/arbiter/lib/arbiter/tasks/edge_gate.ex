defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.EdgeGate do
  @moduledoc """
  One answer to "may this task be dispatched now, given its edges and what is
  already in flight?".

  `Arbiter.Board.Snapshot` → `Arbiter.Board.Scheduler` →
  `Arbiter.Board.Autopilot` drives the board's Ready queue, and since
  bd-a14qd1 it is the only dispatcher. Arbiter used to have a second one (a
  per-graph engine), which answered the edge question separately and had
  drifted: it honoured `:conflicts_with`, the board had never heard of it, and
  a coordinator that set the mutex on two Ready tasks got both dispatched 19
  seconds apart (bd-6bax7s). This module is the single predicate every
  dispatch-time edge question goes through, so no future caller can drift from
  the board again.

  ## The edge types, and what each one does here

    * `:depends_on` / `:blocks` — **gating**. They order work: the dependent
      waits until its dependency is `:verifying` or `:closed`. Normalised by
      `Arbiter.Tasks.DependencyGraph`, and the only types that participate in
      cycle checks.
    * `:conflicts_with` — a **symmetric mutex**. It does not order anything, so
      a task carrying one is still *ready*; it simply may not be dispatched
      while its counterpart is in flight. Stored in one direction and honoured
      in both.
    * `:parent_of`, `:relates_to`, `:discovered_from` — **non-gating**. They
      carry meaning for humans and rollups (`Arbiter.Tasks.ParentRefs`,
      `Arbiter.Tasks.EpicRollup`) and never hold a dispatch back.

  `mutex_types/0` and `non_gating_types/0` sit alongside
  `DependencyGraph.gating_types/0` so the three partition
  `Arbiter.Tasks.Dependency.types/0` exactly — a newly-invented edge type
  fails that test rather than silently defaulting to "non-gating".

  ## Verifying unblocks dependents

  A gating blocker is satisfied once it is `:verifying` or `:closed`
  (`Arbiter.Tasks.Lifecycle.blocker_satisfied?/1`). A blocker that has merged
  and is waiting on its post-merge restart-and-observe no longer holds its
  dependents back (bd-6zapbl). This reverses the long-standing rule that a
  merged ticket waiting on its verification still blocked them: the merge is
  what the dependent builds on, and holding it for the verification stalled
  every chain behind one manual check. `Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.ready/1` and
  `Arbiter.Tasks.EpicRollup` gate on the same predicate, so every surface
  agrees.

  A `:conflicts_with` counterpart is a different question — "is it in flight
  *right now*" — and `:verifying` answers no as well: the work merged, the
  worktree is gone, nothing can collide with it. In-flight-ness is the
  caller's to determine (the board reads live workers) and arrives here as
  `:claimed`.

  ## Shape

  `gate/1` is pure and takes one card's context:

      EdgeGate.gate(%{blocked_by: ["bd-9"], conflicts: ["bd-2"], claimed: ["bd-2"]})
      #=> {:blocked, {:waiting_on, ["bd-9"]}}

  It reports the block, not the prose: `describe/1` phrases it, and each caller
  decorates (the board prefixes `blocked — ` and names the counterpart's
  state). An open blocker outranks a
  conflict because it survives the conflict clearing — telling an operator
  "conflicts with bd-2" when the card is also waiting on an unmerged
  dependency would send them to finish bd-2 for nothing.
