  The ReviewGate park (bd-9zuvbh) — guard class C's terminal state, from design
  #1635 §5.3.

  ## Why this exists

  A ReviewGate guard answers two different questions, and until P9 both were
  answered the same way:

    * *"Should this APPROVE merge?"* — must **fail closed**. bd-6r8caj (an
      APPROVE that never revisits its own open finding) and bd-4yhv4x (an
      APPROVE carrying a `[NOT MET]` criterion) are real, and nothing here
      changes what gets accepted or merged.
    * *"Should this run be marked failed?"* — must **fail open**. That half is
      the entire $226.97: `:review_gate_inconclusive` alone ended 52 runs in 31
      days, and all four chain-B incidents (bd-6dxit2, bd-869mmg, bd-1xss5z,
      bd-c6tdbu) ended the same way — a failed run on work that was fine.

  A park is what "fail open on liveness" looks like on the record. The work is
  committed, the PR is open, the round is recorded honestly (`converged: false`)
  and the work is usually one human decision away from merging — so the durable
  run row says `:review_parked`, not `:failed`, and the task carries a named
  reason a human can act on.

  Whether the branch is *pushed* is checked, never assumed: bd-2jkrqu found the
  escalation asserting "the branch is pushed" over a branch that was not, next
  to an offer to merge it by hand. `Arbiter.Reviews.PushState` answers that
  question for the escalation body, and `:head_not_pushed` is the park for a
  head that could not be put on the remote at all.

  ## A flag, not a status

  The park does **not** move the task out of `:in_progress`. `Tasks.Claim`, the
  board and the dependency graph keep seeing live work, and `Dispatch.resume/2`
  can re-attach to the parked worker the moment someone acts. Contrast
  `:awaiting_verification` (bd-9so315), which is a real status because that task
  *is* finished and merged; a review-parked task is not finished.

  ## Leaving the park

  Two human actions clear it, per §5.3's "human decides" terminal:

    * **re-run the review** — `clear/2`, called when a fresh ReviewGate starts
      for the task (an `arb worker resume` / re-dispatch), and available
      directly for a coordinator that merges by hand;
    * **close the task** — the `:close` action clears the flag inline, so an
      abandoned park does not linger in `arb prime`.

  Stamp the park on `task_id`, and report whether this call is the one that
  claimed the episode.

  The park row **is** the escalation claim (invariant I3: one escalation per
  episode, keyed by `{task_id, mr_ref, guard, episode}`). A task already parked
  for the same reason is the same episode, so it answers `:already_parked` and
  the caller stays quiet; a different reason, or a park the human cleared and
  the gate then re-reached, is a new episode and pages again. That keeps the
  claim in one atomic-ish place rather than in a counter the worker would lose
  on restart — the same reason `ReviewPatrol.claim_review_cap_escalation/1`
  claims in the row rather than in memory.

  Best-effort by design: this runs on the worker's terminal path, and a DB
  hiccup here must not turn a park back into a crash. Callers log and continue.
