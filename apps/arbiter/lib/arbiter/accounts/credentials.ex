defmodule Arbiter.Accounts.Credentials do
  @moduledoc """
  The read side of the provider-account tables: "what credential does a spawn
  for this workspace carry?" (P3 / bd-aiodva,
  `docs/provider-account-design.md` §5 rows 15–18).

  P1 created the tables and P2 populated them; this module is the first thing
  in the running system that *reads* them. Since the P13 flip (bd-9gqj8e) its
  callers (`Arbiter.Agents.Claude.ConfigDir`, `Arbiter.Worker.WorkerEnv`)
  have no other source: the pre-P3 path and the flag that kept it are gone.

  ## The read

  One join hop, exactly as §3.3 describes it: `workspace_provider_accounts`
  (`workspace_id` → account, one row per provider) → the account's **active**
  `provider_credentials` rows → each row's `env_var` and decrypted secret.
  The result is a list of `{env_var, secret}` pairs, which is the shape both
  callers already speak, so `Dispatch`'s spawn env is unchanged (§5 row 20) —
  only the *source* of the value moves.

  Accounts with `enabled: false` supply nothing: parking an account (§3.1) is
  how an operator takes it out of service, and a parked account silently
  continuing to authenticate workers would defeat that. Retired credentials
  supply nothing either — rotation is an insert plus a retire (§3.2), and only
  the active row is current.

  A workspace with no join row resolves to `[]` here. Whether that is benign
  or an operator error is the *caller's* judgement — it is an error only when
  the pre-P3 source would have answered with a credential, which is what
  `Arbiter.Accounts.MissingCredentialError` is for.

  The account's own `/api/oauth/usage`-authenticating credential (P6,
  `docs/provider-account-design.md` §5 row 10 / §9).

  Deliberately keyed on `kind == :cli_credentials_file`, not `env_var` — a
  `:oauth_token` row under `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is a `worker_env` token,
  and bd-4fbpto found that shape cannot authenticate this endpoint at all
  (see PR #1607). Only the credentials-file-sourced secret can, so this is
  the one credential kind `Arbiter.Quota.capture_oauth_usage/2` reads.
  bd-4ag0nj re-checked this before considering a fallback to the
  `:oauth_token` row (the live `claude:default` account's only
  credential): that setup token got `429 rate_limit_error` with a per-token
  `Retry-After` of up to an hour, while the credentials-file token on the
  same account polled `200` twelve seconds later. So an `:oauth_token`-only
  account deliberately stays `:none` here, the poll uses the operator's
  `.credentials.json`, and `Arbiter.Quota.CloudProbe` pages with the lapsed
  interactive login when that file stops working.

  `:none` when the account has no active credential of that kind yet — a
  pre-migration install, or an account minted by `Resolver.ensure_account_id/2`
  with no credential attached — **or when the account itself is parked**
  (`enabled: false`, §3.1): this function is polled every `CloudProbe` cycle
  independent of any workspace, so it has to enforce the module's own
  enabled-only invariant (see the moduledoc) itself rather than relying on a
  workspace-side filter like `account_ids/1` upstream of it. The caller falls
  back to `Arbiter.Quota.OAuthUsage.fetch/1`'s own default (the operator's
  `.credentials.json` on disk) in either case, unchanged from pre-P6
  behavior.

  When an account has more than one active `:cli_credentials_file` row —
  the insert-new-then-retire-old window §3.2 documents mid-rotation — the
  most recently created one wins, so a rotation in progress authenticates
  with the incoming credential rather than an arbitrary pick that could land
  on the outgoing one or flap between the two across polls.
