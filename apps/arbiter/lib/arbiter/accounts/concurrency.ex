defmodule Arbiter.Accounts.Concurrency do
  @moduledoc """
  P8 (`docs/provider-account-design.md` §4.2–§4.4). **The account owns the
  ceiling; the workspace owns a cap on its use of that ceiling.**

      effective_cap(workspace) = min(
          workspace_max,
          system_max,
          account_headroom(account, workspace),
          quota_headroom(account)
      )

      account_headroom(a, ws) =
          max(0, min(a.max_concurrent, share(ws, a)) - live_count(a))

  ## Why this module exists at all

  Before P8 the account-facing ceiling was `dispatchers × workspaces ×
  max_concurrent` (§4.1): several dispatchers in one workspace at
  `max_concurrent: 4` already permitted 8 workers on one account, and
  `system_max` — the only thing above them — knows nothing about accounts.
  Any per-dispatcher tally reproduces that bug, so `live_count/1` is derived
  from `Arbiter.Worker.Registry` and nothing else.

  ## `live_count/1` is registry-derived, and that is the design

  It counts *processes*, via `Arbiter.Worker.Registry.live_dispatches/0`:
  workers currently registered whose workspace points at account `a` for the
  provider they were dispatched with. There is no counter to increment, so
  there is nothing to decrement — a worker that crashes, is killed, or exits
  without running `terminate/2` releases its slot the moment it dies. That is
  the same crash-safety the scheduler's other state has (rebuilt from live
  processes, never remembered).

  Note that `live_count/1` is account-wide even in the `share` term — a
  sibling workspace's live workers do eat into this workspace's headroom.
  That is §4.2's formula as written, and it follows from §4.3: the share is a
  cap on a *shared* ceiling, first-come-first-served between workspaces, not a
  reservation of slots held open for a quiet workspace.

  ## Both terms are opt-in, and `nil` means "no constraint"

  `max_concurrent` migrates to `nil` (§4.4) and `share` has never been
  populated by anything but an explicit `arb account attach --share N`. With
  both `nil` the headroom is `:unlimited` and dispatch behaves exactly as it
  did before P8, bit-for-bit. When only one is set, that one bounds: `min/2`
  over an absent constraint is the present one.
