defmodule Arbiter.Accounts.WorkspaceProviderAccount do
  @moduledoc """
  Phase P1 (`docs/provider-account-design.md` §3.3). The workspace → account
  reference: a join row rather than per-provider FK columns on `workspaces`,
  because the provider set grows (Antigravity is recent) and this is the
  natural home for `share` (§4).

  Read by `Arbiter.Accounts.Credentials` since P3 (bd-aiodva) — it is the
  join hop between a spawn's workspace and the credential it carries.

  Cardinality (§3.4): one account per provider per workspace, enforced by the
  `identity` below. A workspace may have `claude` on one account and `codex`
  on another (different `provider` rows). Multiple workspaces may point at the
  same account. Multiple accounts per provider for *one* workspace is a
  non-goal in v1 — that is the cardinality the unique index deliberately
  forecloses.

  ## Deviation from the design doc

  §3.3 lists `workspace_id` as `string`, but `Arbiter.Tasks.Workspace`'s
  primary key is `uuid_v7_primary_key :id` (a UUID, not a string) — see e.g.
  `Arbiter.Skills.Skill`'s `belongs_to :workspace`. `workspace_id` here is
  typed `:uuid` via `belongs_to` to match the actual schema.
