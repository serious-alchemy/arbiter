defmodule Arbiter.Trackers do
  @moduledoc """
  Entry point for external-tracker calls.

  Reads `issue.tracker_type`, resolves the adapter, and delegates. Callers
  should generally use this module rather than reaching into a specific
  adapter — keeps adapter-resolution centralized so per-task overrides and
  workspace defaults behave consistently.

  ## Resolution rule

  `issue.tracker_type` is an atom in `[:none, :jira, :shortcut, :linear, :github, :gitlab]`. It is
  populated by `Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.Changes.InheritTrackerType` from the
  workspace's `config["tracker"]["type"]` at create-time, unless explicitly
  overridden by the caller.

  Prepare the current process to make adapter calls for `issue` against
  `workspace`.

  The tracker adapters resolve their backend config (owner/repo/credentials for
  GitHub, host/project for Jira, …) from the process dictionary via their
  `Config.put_active/1`. A long-lived process — or an Ash action running outside
  any request lifecycle, such as `:close` from the CLI — must seed that config
  before calling `transition/2`. This keeps the adapter-specific coupling in one
  place; callers stay tracker-agnostic.

  Dispatch is on the *issue's* `tracker_type` (the adapter that will be used),
  while the config payload comes from the *workspace*. A `nil` workspace clears
  the per-process config, letting the adapter fall back to its
  `Application.get_env/3` default. A no-op for `:none`. Mirrors
  `Arbiter.Mergers.prepare/1`.

  Like `prepare/2`, but also overlays a per-repo tracker config override for
  `repo` (the workspace's `repo_paths` key) on top of the workspace-wide
  binding.

  Used where a multi-repo workspace binds different repos to different tracker
  projects (e.g. two GitHub repos filing to different `owner/repo`, or two Jira
  projects on one host). The override lives at
  `workspace.config["tracker"]["config"]["repos"][repo]` and is resolved with
  the same layered-precedence idiom as the merger per-repo overrides (see
  `Arbiter.Mergers.prepare_with_repo/2`).

  `nil`/blank `repo`, or a workspace with no override for it, falls back to
  `prepare/2` unchanged — so single-repo / un-overridden workspaces behave
