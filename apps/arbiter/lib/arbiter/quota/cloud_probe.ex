defmodule Arbiter.Quota.CloudProbe do
  @moduledoc """
  Periodic refresh probe for all quota providers — Anthropic, Codex and
  Antigravity (bd-ajh7bd). The upstream Gemini CLI probe is gone with its
  provider (bd-ac53wz).

  ## Motivation

  Each provider's quota figures come from endpoints outside Arbiter's control,
  and each has its own rate limits. Rather than fetching on every `GET /api/quota`
  call (latency + rate-limit risk) or binding quota state to worker traffic
  (stale when idle or quota-held), this GenServer polls on a recurring timer.
  A poll writes a persistent snapshot and broadcasts `{:quota_updated, ws_id,
  view}` on the `"quota:<ws_id>"` PubSub topic — the same topic the LiveView
  `:quota` hook subscribes to. The prober becomes the *only* place that calls
  out to the external providers, so `GET /api/quota` and `arb quota` are pure DB
  reads (no request-time latency or rate-limit risk).

  For Codex / Antigravity: their figures only ever came from a live
  fetch on each `GET /api/quota` call, and (before this change) Antigravity
  was never persisted at all. The web dashboard, which reads only the persisted
  quota tables, could never show them, and there was no history to audit. This
  GenServer closes that gap.

  ## Refresh strategy

    * `Arbiter.Quota.Codex.fetch/2` — one GET to OpenAI's usage endpoint using
      the `codex` CLI's stored token; upserts `CodexQuota` + broadcasts.
    * `Arbiter.Quota.CloudCode.refresh/3` for `:antigravity` — the `agy` CLI's
      own `/usage` report; upserts `GoogleQuota` + broadcasts.
    * `Arbiter.Quota.capture_oauth_usage_for_group/2` — Anthropic's
      `/api/oauth/usage` source (per-model weekly + `extra_usage` overage,
      bd-8tpha6, *and* the primary gate columns since bd-b0zody). This is the
      only thing that keeps Claude's snapshot current for a fleet making no
      proxied traffic, so it is no longer merely a garnish riding along
      (best-effort; its own 429 cooldown protects it). This endpoint is
      account-wide, so it is fetched **once per distinct provider account**
      represented among this cycle's workspaces (P6,
      `docs/provider-account-design.md` §5 row 10 / §9) — not once per
      workspace, and (since bd-4fbpto) not once for the whole install either:
      three workspaces sharing one plan still produce one fetch, but two
      workspaces on two different accounts now produce two, each
      authenticated with that account's own credential. Its 5 min cadence is
      the endpoint's own per-account budget; the gate absorbs a missed poll by
      trusting a polled row for 600s (`Arbiter.Quota.Gate.staleness_threshold_seconds/1`)
      rather than by polling harder.

      bd-5xuneh originally de-duplicated this call by grouping workspaces on
      `ConfigDir.oauth_token/1` and passing that token explicitly, on the
      theory that workspaces sharing a `worker_env` token could safely share
      one fetch. bd-4fbpto found that theory backwards: a workspace's
      `worker_env` token is scope/rate-limited for this endpoint (empirically
      confirmed — see the status codes recorded in PR #1607) and cannot
      authenticate it at all, so bd-4fbpto deleted that grouping outright
      rather than re-keying it. P6 is the account iteration that replaces it:
      each account's own `cli_credentials_file` credential
      (`Arbiter.Accounts.Credentials.account_oauth_usage_token/1`) — never a
      workspace's `worker_env` token — authenticates its fetch, falling back
      to `Arbiter.Quota.OAuthUsage.fetch/1`'s own default (the operator's
      `.credentials.json` on disk) for an account with no such row — which
      includes an account whose only credential is the `:oauth_token` setup
      token workers run on (bd-4ag0nj re-confirmed that token is 429'd here
      with a per-token `Retry-After` of up to an hour). That fallback is the
      operator's interactive login, which only refreshes while an interactive
      `claude` session runs. When it lapses (401, or the file is gone) *and*
      workers run on their own token rather than a seeded copy of that file,
      the failure escalation below names that cause and the fix
      (`Arbiter.Messages.CoordinatorNotifier.operator_login_lapsed/3`)
      instead of a generic poll failure, and those 401s do not feed the
      Claude credential-expiry streak. With no worker token anywhere, workers
      do use that file, so its 401s keep counting exactly as before.

  The other three providers each degrade to a no-op (no row written, no
  broadcast) when their CLI isn't authenticated on this host, so a logged-out
  provider simply never appears rather than wiping the last good reading.
  Their credentials are host-global, so the figures written under each
  workspace id are identical — we still fan those three out per workspace so
  every workspace's dashboard is fed.

  ## Cadence

  A single `interval_ms` (default 5 min). These are cheap metadata calls that
  spend no model quota, so there's no active/idle split or reset-boundary
  gating — a plain heartbeat is enough.

  ## Configuration

  Via `config :arbiter, :cloud_quota_probe`:

    * `:enabled`     — master switch (default `true`; `false` in test).
    * `:interval_ms` — refresh interval (default 300 000).

  ## Test injection

  Pass `:refresh_fun` — a `fn(workspace_id :: String.t()) :: any()` — to
  `start_link/1` to replace the default three-provider refresh. Tests pass a
  stub so there is no dependency on real CLIs or HTTP.

  Pass `:oauth_opts` — a keyword list forwarded verbatim to
  `Arbiter.Quota.capture_oauth_usage_for_group/2` (and from there to
  `Arbiter.Quota.OAuthUsage.fetch/1`) — to point the account-wide poll at a
  fixture `:source_dir` instead of the real `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, or
  to inject a `:base_url` / `:plug`. Defaults to `[]`.

  Pass `:credential_watchdog` — a `GenServer.server()` — to target a specific
  `Arbiter.Agents.CredentialWatchdog` instance (tests); defaults to the named
  application singleton.

  ## Credential-expiry signals (bd-1pmf9h, generalised bd-1fpjgx)

  Claude, Codex and Antigravity each get a **free** expiry signal off
  the same poll cycle that already fetches their quota — no extra billed
  calls, no worker has to die first:

    * **Claude** — a `{:http_error, 401}` from `/api/oauth/usage`.
      `:oauth_401_expiry_threshold` consecutive 401s (via `start_link/1`
      opts, `config :arbiter, :cloud_quota_probe`, default 2) call
      `Arbiter.Agents.CredentialWatchdog.mark_expired/3` for
      `Arbiter.Agents.Claude`. Any other failure (`:rate_limited`,
      `{:backoff, _}`, a transport error, …) is neutral — it does not reset
      the streak, because a real 429 can legitimately interleave with 401s
      here (the endpoint's own burst bucket refills at ~1 request/5min,
      tight against this poll's own 5-minute cadence — see
      `docs/oauth-usage-ratelimit.md`). Only a genuine success resets it.
    * **Codex** — a `401` from the OpenAI usage GET
      (`Arbiter.Quota.Codex.fetch/2`'s `auth_expired` flag).
      `:codex_401_expiry_threshold` consecutive 401s (default: same as
      Claude's) call `mark_expired/3` for `Arbiter.Agents.Codex`. Every other
      outcome (no local credentials, a non-401 error, a transport failure) is
      neutral for the same reason as Claude's case above; only a `200` reply
      resets the streak.
    * **Antigravity** — an `agy --print "/usage"` row whose `agy`
      subprocess exited non-zero, the one outcome `Arbiter.Quota.CloudCode`
      itself distinguishes as "not authenticated" (its `auth_expired` flag;
      see that module's moduledoc). `:antigravity_auth_expiry_threshold`
      consecutive occurrences (default: same as Claude's) call
      `mark_expired/3` for `Arbiter.Agents.Gemini` — the adapter Antigravity
      runs under (`Arbiter.Agents.adapters/0`). `agy`
      simply not being installed, a subprocess timeout, or unparseable JSON
      say nothing about the credential, so none of them touch the streak;
      only a row with model data (`message: nil`) resets it.

  Each streak is host-global (Codex/Antigravity credentials aren't
  per-workspace), so only the *first* result observed in a probe cycle is
  counted — every workspace's independent fetch would otherwise inflate one
  bad cycle into several.

  Each provider's recovery mirrors the Claude path: a qualifying success
  calls `Arbiter.Agents.CredentialWatchdog.mark_recovered/2` for that
  provider's adapter, the symmetric counterpart to `mark_expired/3`. It does
  so after its own failure streak, and also whenever the provider's
  `Arbiter.Agents.AuthHold` is open (bd-21bmdh) — a passing free check is one
  of that hold's documented reset paths. Pass `:auth_hold` to target a
  specific instance (tests).

  ## What these free signals cannot catch (bd-1fpjgx)

  All three checks read the *operator's* host-global CLI credentials
  (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`, `~/.codex/auth.json`, `agy`'s own
  keyring/ADC), the same ones every workspace's worker inherits by default.
  They therefore:

    * **Cannot see a bad per-workspace token.** A workspace whose
      `worker_env` overrides the CLI credential with its own, broken value
      (the failure bd-bw3466 fixed) still reads as healthy here — the probe
      never touches that override, only the operator's own copy.
    * **Do not prove model-level entitlement.** A `200`/exit-`0` response
      only means the credential authenticates against the *usage* endpoint;
      it says nothing about whether the account is entitled to the specific
      model a worker is about to dispatch against.
    * **Never surface credit exhaustion.** Running out of credits/balance is
      its own `StopReason` category (`:credit_exhausted`), not an
      authentication failure, and no branch here maps into it.
