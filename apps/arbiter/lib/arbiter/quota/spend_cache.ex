defmodule Arbiter.Quota.SpendCache do
  @moduledoc """
  Memoizes `Arbiter.Usage.spend_by_account/1` and `spend_by_workspace/1` —
  the two grouped SQL aggregates `Arbiter.Quota.provider_spend/1` and
  `workspace_spend/1` read from — so the top-bar `:quota` LiveView hook
  (`ArbiterWeb.LiveHooks.on_mount(:quota, ...)`) doesn't pay for a fresh
  30-day ledger scan on every mount (bd-4p6pw7: 46 queries, ~0.7-1.0s, one
  per account/workspace/view, before this cache existed).

  A 30-second TTL covers repeat mounts/navigations within the window with
  zero queries; `invalidate/0` (called from `Arbiter.Usage.Event`'s
  `:create` / `:refresh_snapshot` actions — see that resource's `actions`
  block) drops it early the moment new usage lands, so a worker's session
  finishing doesn't leave the top bar showing stale spend for up to the TTL.
  `:backfill_usage` doesn't accept `cost_usd` (see that action), so it can't
  change a total and doesn't need to invalidate. `Accounts.Merge`'s raw
  `update_all` on `usage_events.provider_account_id` also bypasses this and
  relies on the TTL alone — it repoints existing rows' account rather than
  changing any `cost_usd`, so the account-keyed totals it affects are stale
  for at most the TTL, same as any other cache miss window.

  Backed by a `:public` ETS table owned by this GenServer so any process can
  read/write it without round-tripping a message — the table survives a
  crash-restart of this process (it isn't `:protected`ed to the owner), and
  reads never block on the GenServer being free. The SQL itself always runs
  in the *calling* process (never here), so it rides that process's own DB
  connection — required under `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox` in tests, where
  only the calling (test) process holds a checked-out connection.
