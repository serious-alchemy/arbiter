defmodule Arbiter.Quota.Gate.Continue do
  @moduledoc """
  Overage `Arbiter.Quota.Gate` (bd-7cd38f): keep dispatching past the cap.

  For installs that pay the standard API rate once the plan quota is depleted.
  Always returns `:allow` so dispatch proceeds — but when the latest snapshot
  shows past-plan usage (`overage_status == "in_overage"`, or the primary window
  is no longer `"allowed"`) it returns `{:overage, spend_usd}`, where `spend_usd`
  is the windowed overage spend the dispatcher records and alerts on. The
  guardrail is **cap + alert, never stop**: the dispatcher fires one alert per
  `overage_alert_usd` crossing but dispatch is never blocked.

  Provider-neutral (bd-2mpo3f): the snapshot may be an `AnthropicQuota`,
  `CodexQuota` or `GoogleQuota` row. Only Anthropic reports an explicit
  `overage_status`; for Codex / Google the past-plan `status` (Codex's
  `limit_reached`) is the trigger, and `spend_usd` is the same windowed
  spend from the usage ledger.

  `spend_usd` is the **account's** windowed spend since P7 (§5 row 9): the
  plan that was exhausted is the account's, so the overage figure has to be
  too. The account arrives as `opts[:account]` from
  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch`; without one (a caller that has not resolved an
  account, or a workspace with no link) the spend is `0.0` and dispatch still
  proceeds — the contract is cap + alert, never stop.

  Fails open on a `nil` (or unrecognized) snapshot — plain `:allow`, no overage
  tag. A stale snapshot is judged by `Gate.in_overage?/2`: a reading that
  shows the cap reached keeps tagging overage until its window resets, even
  once it is too old for the gate to hold on (bd-2wnkoq).
