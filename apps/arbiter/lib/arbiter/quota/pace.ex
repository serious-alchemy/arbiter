  @moduledoc """
  The per-window pace verdict (bd-clzkvp): the one definition of "ahead of
  pace" that both the dispatch gate and the quota bars read.

  `evaluate/4` is pure. It takes one window's utilization, how far into the
  window we are, the window's length, and the thresholds that apply to it,
  and returns a verdict:

    * `:holding` — `utilization >= ceiling`. This is exactly the condition
      under which `Arbiter.Quota.Gate` holds dispatch on the window's
      utilization rule; the gate makes that decision through this function.
    * `:approaching` — within `#{@approaching_margin}` (ten percentage points of the window)
      of the ceiling: `utilization >= ceiling - #{@approaching_margin}`. On a paced ceiling
      that is the last tenth of a window's worth of on-pace burn before the
      gate would hold — 30 minutes of a 5h window, about 17 hours of a 7d one.
    * `:sampling` — neither of the above, and either less than `#{@sampling_floor}` of
      the window has elapsed (15 minutes of 5h, ~8.4 hours of 7d) or less
      than `#{@sampling_floor}` of it is used. Too early or too little to call a pace.
    * `:ok` — none of the above, including no utilization reading at all.

  `:holding` and `:approaching` outrank `:sampling`: a paced floor makes the
  ceiling meaningful from the first second, so the gate holds however early a
  window is, and the verdict must say so.

  ## The ceiling

  The thresholds argument is `%{sides: [side], default: ceiling}` — the
  gate's `min(account, workspace)` composition, already resolved into one
  entry per side that configured anything:

    * `{:paced, floor, flat_fallback}` — `max(floor, elapsed)`, where
      `elapsed` is the elapsed fraction of the window; without a known
      `elapsed` (no window length, no reset) it falls back to the side's own
      flat ceiling, or drops out when it has none.
    * `{:flat, ceiling}` — a fixed ceiling.

  Each side is turned into a number for *now* and the smallest wins, ties
  going to the earlier side; with no side left, `default` applies. See
  "Threshold modes" in `Arbiter.Quota.Gate` for where each number comes from.
