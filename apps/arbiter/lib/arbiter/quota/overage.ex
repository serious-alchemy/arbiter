defmodule Arbiter.Quota.Overage do
  @moduledoc """
  Overage-spend accounting for `:continue`-mode dispatch (bd-7cd38f).

  When a workspace dispatches past the Anthropic plan cap (see
  `Arbiter.Quota.Gate.Continue`), we account the overage as the **provider
  account's** spend over the current 5h window, read straight from the
  token-cost ledger (`Arbiter.Usage.summarize/1`). This is the zero-migration
  v1 approach from the bd-3qcd8y design: a windowed sum of `cost_usd`, not a
  per-request tag.

  The sum is `by: :provider_account` since P7
  (`docs/provider-account-design.md` §5 row 9) — the plan that was exhausted
  is the account's, so every workspace metered under it contributes to the
  overage figure, and the window comes from the account's snapshot.

  The window is `[reset_5h_at - 5h, now]` — i.e. spend since the current 5h
  window opened. When the snapshot carries no `reset_5h_at`, or one that has
  already passed (a stale snapshot whose window closed, bd-2wnkoq), we fall
  back to the trailing 5 hours from now — see `window_start/2`.

  The **account's** total spend (USD) over the current 5h window — the figure
  the overage indicator and alert threshold compare against. Returns `0.0` on
  any read error so accounting never disrupts dispatch.

  Keyed by the provider account since P7 (§5 row 9): the plan whose cap was
  passed is the account's, so the spend that ran past it is every workspace's
  on that account, not just the one whose dispatch happened to trip the gate.
  Accepts a `ProviderAccount`, a bare account id, or anything else (which
  spends `0.0`).

  Start of the current 5h window as a `DateTime`, as of `now` (default
  `DateTime.utc_now/0`). Derived from the snapshot's primary-window reset
  while that reset is still ahead of `now` (the window opens 5h before it
  resets); otherwise the trailing `now - 5h`.

  A reset at or before `now` means the window it describes has **closed** —
  the snapshot is stale, and the current window's reset is unknown. Deriving
  the start from it would stretch "the current 5h window" back to one that
  ended hours ago and sum all the spend since (bd-2wnkoq), so that case takes
  the same trailing-5h approximation as a snapshot with no reset at all.

  Accepts a normalized `Arbiter.Quota.Gate.Snapshot` (any provider) as well as a
  raw `AnthropicQuota` row. The 5h span is Anthropic's; for Codex / Google —
  which have no paid-overage passthrough — this is only ever the accounting
  window for the alert figure, so the trailing-5h approximation is deliberate.
