  Single resolver for the on-disk roots that must never bake in a
  developer's home directory: `worktree_root/0`
  (`Arbiter.Worker.Worktree`, `Arbiter.Reviews.Checkout`),
  `output_log_root/0` (`Arbiter.Worker.OutputLog`) and `sessions_root/0`
  (`Arbiter.Sessions.Layout`) — plus `primary_checkout/0`, the live source
  tree those roots must stay outside of (RFC §10.2).

  A release doesn't load `config/dev.exs`, so a plain
  `Application.get_env(:arbiter, :worktree_root, "/some/other/box/arbiter-worktrees")`
  fallback bakes one developer's home directory into every release.
  Resolution order, checked fresh on every call (no caching, so
  `ARBITER_*` env vars take effect immediately — note this also means an
  `ARBITER_*` var exported in a shell outranks any test's own
  `Application.put_env/3`):

    1. environment variable (`ARBITER_WORKTREE_ROOT` / `ARBITER_OUTPUT_LOG_ROOT`)
    2. application config (`config :arbiter, :worktree_root, ...`) — set by
       `config/dev.exs`, `config/test.exs`, or a test's own
       `Application.put_env/3`
    3. `$HOME`-relative default, expanded at call time

  The **primary checkout** — the source tree the live server runs from, and the
  thing RFC §10.2 exists to keep sessions out of.

  Resolution mirrors `scripts/build-local-release.sh` and
  `ArbiterCli.Cmd.Start.project_root/0` so all three agree on what "the live
  checkout" means:

    1. `ARB_PRIMARY_CHECKOUT` — the explicit override, same as the script's.
    2. `config :arbiter, :primary_checkout` — explicit configuration.
    3. `ARB_HOME` — how the server is started.
    4. `~/.config/arbiter/home` — recorded by `arb install-service`.
    5. `~/dev/arbiter`.

  Note the order differs from `worktree_root/0` and friends above, which put
  their environment variable first. `ARB_HOME` is **ambient**, not an override:
  it is exported into every process the server spawns (including every worker
  and every test run started from a checkout), so treating it the way those
  roots treat their dedicated `ARBITER_*` vars would mean an explicit
  configuration could never win. `ARB_PRIMARY_CHECKOUT` is the dedicated
  override and keeps its place at the top.

  Returns `nil` when nothing resolves (no `HOME`), which callers must treat as
  "the guard is inactive" rather than "there is no checkout" — an unresolved
  checkout is exactly the case `build-local-release.sh` warns loudly about.
  `Arbiter.Sessions.Layout.outside_primary_checkout?/2` reads it that way.

  Directories holding Claude Code session JSONLs that belong to the
  **coordinator**, swept by `Arbiter.Sessions.UsageIngest` (bd-be804c).

  them. On the dogfood host that is

  silently meter nothing or, worse, bill an unrelated project's sessions to
  the fleet, so an install that wants coordinator metering names its
  directories explicitly.
