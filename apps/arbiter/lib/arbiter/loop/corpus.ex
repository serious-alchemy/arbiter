defmodule Arbiter.Loop.Corpus do
  @moduledoc """
  The read layer for the Stage 1 loop-analysis pass (bd-dyfaq3, epic #1011):
  fetch one window of the loop's own telemetry as enriched
  `worker_runs`, and record the pass's own cost.

  `fetch/1` joins `worker_runs ⨝ usage_events ⨝ review_gate_rounds ⨝ issues`
  for a window and returns one row per `worker_run`, enriched with its work
  cost, max review round, reviewer findings, the issue's dispatched difficulty,
  and — **only for failed runs** — the bounded *tail* of its transcript
  (`Arbiter.Worker.OutputLog.tail_lines/2`). `Arbiter.Loop.Analysis.build_report/2`
  reasons over those rows purely.

  ## Read discipline (this is the module the crashed first attempt lacked)

  Everything here is a **bounded aggregate**: grouped counts and sums keyed by
  run/task, never `SELECT *` over a 400-row table, and transcript reads are
  bounded per failed run. That is deliberate — attempt 1 at this task
  (`c88c77b0`) died of context exhaustion from unbounded reads. The whole point
  of doing the fetch in Elixir is that the operator's context never sees the
  raw corpus, only the shaped report.

  ## Structured first, transcript only as fallback (bd-apwfmy)

  A failed run whose typed `stop_category` already decides its classification
  (see `Arbiter.Loop.FailureClassifier.conclusive_stop_categories/0`) gets **no
  transcript read at all** — `terminal_lines` stays `[]` and the classifier
  works off the column. Only runs with no category, or an inconclusive one
  (`:crashed`, `:stalled`), fall back to the bounded read below. `meta`
  reports `failed_runs` and `transcript_reads` so a window says out loud how
  much of itself still had to be text-mined.

  `transcript_reads` counts the *fallback decision*, carried on each row as
  `transcript_read?` — not the reads that happened to return lines. A run
  whose output log was reaped still had to fall back; scoring it as zero
  reads would report a blind window as a fully-structured one.

  ## Finding residue (bd-5ja2vb)

  `Arbiter.Loop.FindingBuckets.bucket_finding/1` is a four-regex allowlist; a
  reviewer finding matching none of them is the pass's other blind spot,
  symmetric to an unclassified `failure_reason`. `meta.finding_residue`
  reports it: `total_units` (every finding unit from a `role: review`,
  non-`approve` round in the window), `count` (the ones no bucket matched),
  `rate`, `distinct_tasks`, and `units` — the residue itself, retained (not
  just counted) so a detector merged later can be backfilled over the actual
  corpus instead of accumulating evidence from zero. Retention is bounded:
  at most `residue_retention_limit/0` units, newest-first, each truncated to
  `residue_text_limit/0` characters — the same "bounded, not raw" discipline
  as the transcript tail above. This is computed over **every** matching
  round in the window, independent of `failure_reason` classification —
  unlike `Arbiter.Loop.Analysis`'s `finding_categories`, which only clusters
  the agent-quality-classified subset for prompt-shaping purposes.

  A fallback run's `terminal_lines` is the union of two bounded reads
  (`OutputLog.tail_lines/2` + `OutputLog.scan_for/2`), not a raw transcript
  read — see bd-3ozmaj (#1159) and the "bounded scan" note in
  `docs/loop-review.md`:

    * the last `@tail_n` (40) lines — the terminal signal (autocompact
      thrash, `claude session error`, final `arb done`).
    * every line matching `FailureClassifier.infra_fingerprints/0` — narrow,
      unambiguous infra fingerprints (`Phoenix.Ecto.PendingMigrationError`,
      `DBConnection.ConnectionError`) that can appear anywhere in the
      transcript, not just its tail, because the agent typically keeps going
      after the failure. This scan reads the whole file but returns only the
      (typically zero or one) matching lines — safe because the fingerprint
      list is narrow enough to carry no false-positive risk, and the corpus
      is small (tens of files, single-digit MB).

  ## Quota-window enrichment (#1463, Amendment E)

  Each row also carries `weighted_tokens` — its draw on the binding 5-hour
  utilization window — and `window_share_5h`, that draw as a fraction of one
  window's calibrated capacity. `meta.scarcity` carries the calibration, the
  installation's billing mode, and which unit the pass is therefore optimising.
  `Arbiter.Loop.Scarcity` owns the unit definition and the reasoning behind it;
  this module only supplies the two bounded reads it needs (per-run token sums
  over the corpus window, and the fleet's total weighted draw between the
  *current* 5h window's start and the instant the snapshot was captured, which
  is the interval the provider's `utilization_5h` reading describes). Both reads
  are fleet-wide, so the calibration's numerator and the per-run numerator cover
  the same population — see the "Coverage" section of `Arbiter.Loop.Scarcity`
  for why that matters and what bias survives it.

  A `window_share_5h` of `nil` means the window could not be calibrated —
  never "this run drew nothing". `meta.scarcity.calibration.reason` says which
  absence it was (`:no_snapshot`, `:stale_snapshot`, `:no_utilization`,
  `:no_observed_tokens`), the same way `transcript_reads` refuses to report a
  blind window as a fully-structured one.

  ## CI: the PR cohort and its fix_passes (bd-cuu8n3)

  `meta.ci` feeds `Arbiter.Loop.CiSection`. It carries two bounded sets:

    * `tasks` — one entry per task with an authoring run in the window,
      attributed to its **latest** main run there (repo, provider, model,
      workspace) plus the issue's difficulty and whether it has a PR
      (`issues.pr_ref`).
    * `fix_passes` — every `:fix_pass` run started in the window, with the
      `evidence` `Arbiter.Loop.FixPassClassifier.classify/1` reads:
      the failing checks recovered from the run's archived prompt
      (`Arbiter.Worker.PromptLog`), step signals from `worker_run_steps` (did
      it edit/commit, re-run a job, call `ci_mark_external`), and its closing
      summary — the CLI's own `result_message` when captured, else the prose in
      the last 60 lines of its transcript. Each read is bounded per run, like
      the failed-run tail above.
    * `flake_events` — every `Arbiter.Loop.FlakeEvent` row recorded in the
      window (bd-6vullc): a fix_pass's own structured conclusion that a CI
      failure was a flake or infra issue, with repo, CI job, test file:line
      when identified, a short failure signature, and task/run ids.
      `Arbiter.Loop.CiSection` groups these to surface recurring flakes.

  ## The one write

  `record_pass_cost/1` inserts a single `Arbiter.Usage.Event` row (step
  `:other`, `source: :maintenance`, no task) so the loop's own cost lands in
  the ledger it is optimising. It is the **only** write the pass performs — no
  skills, no config, no issue overrides.

  Before bd-adyhvn that row carried a synthetic `task_id` of `loop-analyze`,
  because `task_id` was NOT NULL — which made `arb usage --by task` grow a
  phantom "task" that never existed. `task_id` is nullable now and `source`
  says what the row is, so the sentinel is gone (the migration clears it from
  the historical rows too).
