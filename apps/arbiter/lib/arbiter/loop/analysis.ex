defmodule Arbiter.Loop.Analysis do
  @moduledoc """
  The Stage 1 loop-analysis pass (bd-dyfaq3): turn a window of enriched
  `worker_runs` into an operator-facing `Arbiter.Loop.Report`, and record the
  pass's own cost in the ledger it is optimising.

  `build_report/2` is the pure core — it reasons over already-fetched corpus
  rows and writes nothing. `analyze/1` is the shell: it fetches the window via
  `Arbiter.Loop.Corpus`, builds the report, and records a single
  `usage_events` row for the pass itself (the only write the pass performs — it
  edits no skills, config, or task overrides).

  ## Discipline encoded here

    * Failures are segmented operational vs agent-quality by allowlist
      (`Arbiter.Loop.FailureClassifier`); operational reasons are excluded from
      every prompt-shaping output.
    * `failure_reason` is corroborated against the transcript; the
      label↔transcript disagreement rate is a first-class finding.
    * The **evidence bar** for a fleet-wide suggestion is ≥ 3 incidents across
      ≥ 2 distinct tasks. Below it, a finding becomes a paper-trailed per-task
      override and the report **declines** a fleet-wide change. The thresholds
      default to those constants and are overridable per workspace under
      `loop.evidence_bar.{min_incidents,min_distinct_tasks}` (bd-9j2g3x).
    * Comparisons are grouped into `(difficulty, repo)` cells so drift with the
      difficulty/repo mix does not read as improvement.
    * The **objective function** is denominated in the unit that actually binds
      (#1463, Amendment E). Under subscription billing that is
      `window_share_5h` — a task's draw on the 5-hour utilization window, the
      window `Arbiter.Quota.Gate` throttles on — with imputed dollars retained
      as a secondary figure. Under metered API billing dollars still bind and
      stay primary. `Arbiter.Loop.Scarcity` owns the decision and its reasoning;
      `Arbiter.Loop.Corpus` supplies the calibration on `meta.scarcity`.

  Run the pass over a window: fetch, analyse, record own cost, return the
  report + rendered markdown.

  Options are passed to `Arbiter.Loop.Corpus.fetch/1` (`:since`, `:until`,
  `:limit`, `:label`). Returns `{:ok, %{report: %Report{}, markdown: String,
  usage_event_id: id | nil}}`.

  ## `discover?: true` (opt-in, bd-4f6opo)

  Off by default, and the default path is **byte-identical** to before and
  makes no model call. Opted in, `Arbiter.Loop.Discovery.run/2` makes one
  bounded model call over the window's finding residue and the report gains a
  `discovery` section of candidate detectors that passed a deterministic
  pre-check. It writes nothing but its own `usage_events` row (step
  `:loop_discovery`); its candidates never reach `Arbiter.Loop.record/2`, so
  combining it with `propose?: true` queues exactly what `propose?` alone does.
  `:invoker` is passed through to `Discovery.run/2`.

  ## `propose?: true` (opt-in, bd-9j2g3x)

  Off by default, and the default path is **byte-identical** to before Stage 2:
  the pass still writes nothing but its own cost row. Opted in, each suggestion
  is additionally persisted as an `Arbiter.Loop.PendingWrite` — inserted, or
  reinforced onto the row with the same fingerprint from an earlier window — and
  the returned map gains a `:proposals` key. Proposals are inert: queueing one
  applies nothing, at any evidence level.

  A candidate `Arbiter.Loop.record/2` refuses (e.g. a `:fleet` candidate on
  an install with no unambiguous default workspace, bd-3dasqm) is not queued
  and is not silently lost either: it is counted in `:proposals_dropped`
  (`[%{gist:, reason:}]`) so an operator on such an install can see the
  fleet-finding stream is going missing, rather than only a log line.

  #     more *attempts* failed for an agent-quality reason before the task
  #     converged (vs-8i7rod: rounds: 1, 3 attempts, $5.59). This is a cost
  #     signal, not evidence the reviewer under-provisioned rounds — reusing
  #     the rework wording/baseline here is what over-fired 16/133 tasks.

  # Context-exhaustion is deliberately EXCLUDED from quality_failure?: per the
  # worked example in the ticket, an agent burning its own context window is a
  # read-discipline problem, not a difficulty misestimate. It is surfaced
