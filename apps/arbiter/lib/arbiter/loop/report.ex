defmodule Arbiter.Loop.Report do
  @moduledoc """
  The data contract + markdown renderer for the Stage 1 loop-analysis pass
  (bd-dyfaq3, epic #1011).

  `Arbiter.Loop.Analysis` computes every number and packs it into a `%Report{}`;
  `to_markdown/1` is a pure formatter with no database or I/O, so the exact
  markdown the operator reads is testable in isolation. Keeping the struct
  separate from the analysis means the discipline the report must enforce lives
  in one inspectable shape:

    * `segmentation` — operational vs agent-quality counts, with `run_ids` so
      every claim is cited. Operational is shown but flagged excluded from
      prompt-shaping.
    * `misclassification` — the rate at which `failure_reason` disagreed with
      the transcript, a **first-class corpus-integrity finding**, with the
      corrected run_ids (the c88c77b0 lesson).
    * `cells` / `difficulty_misestimates` — comparisons segmented by
      `(difficulty, repo)`, never across cells.
    * `suggestions` — each names a target metric, a baseline, a destination
      (skill / repo `CLAUDE.md` / per-task override) and its evidence tier, so
      a single incident visibly **declines** a fleet-wide change.
    * `scarcity` — the **unit the pass optimises against** (#1463, epic #1011
      Amendment E): which of `window_share_5h` / `cost_usd` binds at this
      installation, how the billing mode was determined (configured vs
      inferred), and the 5h-window calibration every per-run share was divided
      by — including a machine-readable reason when that calibration failed, so
      an uncalibrated window never renders as a cheap one.
    * `finding_residue` (bd-5ja2vb) — the reviewer-finding units
      `Arbiter.Loop.FindingBuckets.bucket_finding/1` matched to no bucket, a
      **first-class corpus-integrity finding** symmetric with
      `misclassification` above: count, rate, distinct tasks and a retained,
      bounded, newest-first sample with `{task_id, run_id}` citations.
    * `ci` (bd-cuu8n3) — the first-push CI red rate (share of PR-bearing
      tasks that needed ≥ 1 fix_pass) by repo, provider/model and difficulty,
      and every fix_pass's deterministic outcome class with the `unknown`
      share reported. Built by `Arbiter.Loop.CiSection`; carries the
      approved-PR-only undercount verbatim.
    * `discovery` (bd-4f6opo) — `nil` unless the pass ran with
      `discover?: true`; then the candidate detectors
      `Arbiter.Loop.Discovery` proposed over the residue above and verified
      deterministically, with the rejected ones counted and explained. A `nil`
      renders nothing, so the default report is unchanged.
    * `notes` — the small-sample caveats, rendered verbatim.

    bar visibly declines a fleet-wide change.
