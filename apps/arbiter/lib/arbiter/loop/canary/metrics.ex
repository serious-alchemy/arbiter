defmodule Arbiter.Loop.Canary.Metrics do
  @moduledoc """
  The measurement behind a Stage 3 canary: what each arm actually did.

  Everything here is derived from telemetry Arbiter already writes —
  `worker_runs`, `review_gate_rounds`, `usage_events`. No new dispatch-time
  recording, no migration, and nothing that has to be kept in sync with the
  routing decision: the arm is recomputed from the task id with the same
  function routing used, so a run recorded before this module existed is still
  attributable.

  Two numbers per arm:

    * **first-pass ReviewGate convergence** — of the tasks that reached review,
      the fraction whose *first* review round converged. This is the metric a
      routing-tier change is trying to move, and the one a regression reverts
      on;
    * **cost per review round** — reported for the operator's benefit, never a
      revert trigger. A tier change that buys convergence with money is a
      judgement call, not a regression.

  Reads follow the Corpus discipline: raw `Repo.query!/2` with bound
  parameters, scoped to the canary's own window and workspace, `IN` lists
  chunked so a long-running canary cannot build an unbounded statement.

  `first_pass_convergence` and `cost_per_round` are `nil` when the arm has
  nothing to divide by — an absent measurement, never a zero.

  A dispatch a routing floor clamped (`worker_runs.floor_clamped`, bd-c675ny)
  did not get the rule its arm assigned — a canaried rule below the floor was
  raised to it, a baseline rule too — so it says nothing about either rule and
  is left out of both arms. `clamped` is how many were left out.
