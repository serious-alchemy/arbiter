  The `:repo_doc_patch` **side effect**: rung 2 of the destination ladder
  (Amendment D). A repo-scoped lesson lands as a patch to that repo's
  `CLAUDE.md`, applied through the normal PR path — not a direct table write,
  since the target is a file humans also edit.

      Worktree.create/3       an isolated branch to commit into
      RepoDocPatch.upsert/4   owns the delimited managed section, so a human
                              edit and an Arbiter edit never clobber each other
      Mergers.for_workspace/1 opens the PR the way any other change would be

  Split out of `Arbiter.Loop` (bd-3b7svv): this was the largest single slice of
  the apply path, and its pure decisions — which repo, which path, which cap,
  what the commit and PR say — are worth pinning without provisioning a git
  repo per assertion.
