defmodule Arbiter.Loop.Flakes do
  @moduledoc """
  `record/1` is the only writer of `Arbiter.Loop.FlakeEvent` rows (bd-6vullc).
  Its only call site is the `flake_record` MCP tool
  (`Arbiter.MCP.Tools.flake_record/2`), reached from a fix_pass that
  concludes a CI failure was a flake or infra issue — it re-ran the job with
  no code change and it went green (or is marking it broken repo-wide).

  `latest_fix_pass_run_id/1` resolves the `run_id` to attach: the fix_pass
  worker calling the tool has no run id of its own to hand over (its MCP
  scope only carries `task_id`), so this looks up the most recently started
  `fix_pass` `worker_runs` row for the task. Best-effort — a miss (the row
  raced, or was already superseded) leaves `run_id` nil rather than failing
  the whole record.
