defmodule Arbiter.Loop.CanaryTicker do
  @moduledoc """
  The driver behind Stage 3's *auto*-revert (bd-6edc0u).

  `Arbiter.Loop.Canary` knows how to start, judge, promote and revert a canary,
  but something has to ask it to. If that something were the operator, the
  revert would not be automatic — it would be a chore with a nicer name. This
  singleton GenServer walks every workspace on a timer and calls
  `Canary.tick/2` on each, so a regressing routing rule is taken back on its own
  within one interval of the evidence arriving.

  For a workspace that has not set `loop.autonomous_routing_enabled`, `tick/2`
  returns `{:ok, :disabled}` after a single map lookup and nothing else happens
  — no reads, no writes, no mail. That is every workspace by default, which is
  what keeps this process inert until an operator deliberately opts one in. The
  sole exception is a workspace whose flag was unset *while a canary was
  running*: the next tick clears the leftover block, once, so re-enabling the
  flag later starts a clean canary instead of judging a window the canary spent
  switched off (see `Arbiter.Loop.Canary`'s moduledoc).

  Each workspace is ticked under its own rescue: one bad config block, or one
  failed write, must not stop the cycle before it reaches the workspace whose
  canary is regressing.

  After the workspaces, each cycle runs the earned-trust fold once,
  installation-wide (`Arbiter.Loop.Trust.tick/1`, G18): the trust records, and
  the automatic suspensions, demotions and promotion proposals they call for.
  `config :arbiter, :loop_trust, enabled: false` turns that half off.

  ## Configuration

  Via `config :arbiter, :loop_canary_ticker`:

    * `:enabled`     — master switch (default `true`; `false` in test, where
                       tests drive `poll/1` synchronously instead).
    * `:interval_ms` — tick interval (default 15 minutes — a canary needs 20
                       dispatches to say anything, so there is nothing to gain
                       from looking more often).
