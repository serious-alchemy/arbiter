defmodule Arbiter.Loop.Scarcity do
  @moduledoc """
  The loop's **unit of scarcity** (#1463, epic #1011 Amendment E).

  Stage 1 originally denominated everything it optimises in imputed dollars:
  the corpus joined `usage_events` for a per-run `cost_usd`, proposals carried
  cost-shaped `target_metric`/`baseline`, and cell comparisons ranked tasks by
  spend. Amendment E observed that on a Claude subscription

  > the marginal dollar cost of the next Claude token is zero… what is
  > genuinely finite is the 5-hour and 7-day utilization windows

  so the loop was optimising a unit that does not bind. This module is the
  decision, in code. The full reasoning — including the units considered and
  rejected — is in `docs/loop-scarcity-unit.md`.

  ## The unit: `window_share_5h`

  **A run's draw on one 5-hour utilization window, as a fraction of that
  window's capacity.** Not the 7-day window, and not raw utilization:

    * **5h, not 7d.** The 5h window is what actually stalls dispatch here —
      `Arbiter.Quota.Gate.Snapshot` normalizes *only* the primary window and
      Anthropic gating "keys on the 5h window and ignores the 7d one". A metric
      denominated in the window that does not gate would describe a constraint
      that never binds. The 7d window is carried alongside as context
      (`utilization_7d` on the calibration) but is not the objective.
    * **Per-run share, not observed utilization.** `anthropic_quotas` is a
      *latest-only cache* — one upserted row per `{workspace_id, provider}`,
      explicitly "a cache of the latest reading, not a time series". There is
      no historical utilization to join a 7-day corpus against, so utilization
      cannot be read per run retrospectively. What *is* per-run is the token
      ledger: `usage_events` carries `tokens_in` / `tokens_out` /
      `cache_creation_tokens` / `cache_read_tokens` with an `occurred_at`,
      keyed by `worker_run_id`. Window utilization is monotone in weighted
      token consumption, so a run's *share* of a window is attributable even
      though the window's history is not.

  ## Weighting, and why an approximate vector is sound

  Anthropic does not publish the token weighting behind the unified windows, so
  `weights/0` uses the published *pricing* ratios as the proxy (input 1.0,
  cache-write 1.25, cache-read 0.1, output 5.0 — Sonnet's $3 / $3.75 / $0.30 /
  $15 per Mtok).

  This is safe against the obvious objection because capacity is **calibrated
  from the same weighting**: `calibrate/2` divides the observed weighted draw of
  the current window by the observed `utilization_5h`, so any global scale error
  in the vector appears in numerator and denominator alike and cancels. Only the
  *relative* weights matter, and the relative cost of a cached read versus an
  output token is the one thing pricing does tell us. (There is a test pinning
  exactly this cancellation.)

  ## Fail-soft, never fabricated

  Every function degrades to `nil` rather than to a plausible-looking zero. An
  install with no captured snapshot, a *stale* snapshot, an idle calibration
  window, or a `0.0` utilization reading yields `status: :uncalibrated` with a
  machine-readable `reason`, and `window_share/2` returns `nil`.
  `Arbiter.Loop.Report` renders that absence out loud — a blind window must not
  read as a cheap one, which is the same discipline `Arbiter.Loop.Corpus`
  applies to `transcript_reads`.

  Staleness is the sharpest of those cases, because it is the one that fails
  *plausibly* rather than visibly. `anthropic_quotas` is a latest-only cache, so
  `Arbiter.Quota.latest/2` happily returns a reading from a window that rolled
  yesterday. Its `reset_5h_at` then places the window start a day in the past
  while `utilization_5h` describes a window that has since reset several times
  over, so a draw summed up to `now` would be divided by a utilization figure
  measured over a different — and much shorter — interval, inflating capacity by
  roughly the number of elapsed windows and deflating every share by the same
  factor. `calibrate/3` therefore takes an explicit `:stale` snapshot and
  refuses to calibrate from it (`reason: :stale_snapshot`), reusing
  `Arbiter.Quota.Gate.stale?/1` — the predicate the dispatch gate already fails
  open on for the 5h window — as the single definition of "too old to trust".
  (The gate's long-window predicate, `long_window_stale?/1`, is deliberately
  stickier; it is irrelevant here because calibration divides by
  `utilization_5h`.)

  ## Coverage: capacity is a lower bound, shares are upper bounds

  Calibration divides *Arbiter's observed weighted draw* by the *account's*
  reported utilization. Those two have different coverage, and the asymmetry is
  one-directional:

    * `usage_events` only records what Arbiter itself dispatched. An interactive
      Claude Code session on the same plan raises `utilization_5h` without
      writing a row — on this installation that is the common case, not an edge
      case.
    * Both sides are read **fleet-wide**: `Arbiter.Loop.Corpus` deliberately does
      not filter its per-run numerator by workspace (some `usage_events` rows
      legitimately carry a `nil` `workspace_id`), so the calibration's observed
      draw must not filter either, or numerator and denominator would describe
      different populations and inflate every share by the ratio between them.

  What remains after scoping both sides identically is non-Arbiter traffic, which
  under-counts `observed`, hence under-estimates `capacity = observed /
  utilization`, hence **over-estimates** every share. So `window_share_5h` is an
  upper bound on a run's true draw, and a share above 100% of a window is a known
  over-estimate rather than a measurement. This is reported out loud on the
  report's calibration line. It does not undermine the *comparisons* the loop
  makes — the bias is a single scale factor shared by every run in the window, so
  the ranking within a `(difficulty, repo)` cell is unaffected — but it does mean
  an absolute share should be read as "at most this much of a window".

  ## Billing mode

  Dollars are still the right unit under metered API billing, so the loop does
  not delete them — it *ranks* them. `billing_mode/2` decides which unit leads,
  and is readable at analysis time rather than assumed:

    1. `loop.billing_mode` in workspace config (`"subscription"` / `"metered"`)
       → `{mode, :configured}`.
    2. Otherwise, a captured `AnthropicQuota` snapshot carrying a unified 5h
       utilization figure is direct evidence of a plan with windows →
       `{:subscription, :inferred}`.
    3. Otherwise `{:metered, :default}` — no window evidence, so dollars remain
       the only unit that is readable at all.

  `primary_metric/1` turns that into the objective the report and proposals
  denominate in; the other metric is retained and reported as secondary.
