defmodule Arbiter.Loop.Canary do
  @moduledoc """
  **Stage 3** of the loop-engineering epic (#1011, task bd-6edc0u): the one
  narrow slice of the proposal queue that Arbiter is allowed to apply to itself
  without a human — a **routing-tier adjustment**, applied to a *subset* of
  dispatches, measured against the untouched arm, and reverted automatically if
  it makes things worse.

  Everything else in the queue stays operator-applied. Skill bodies are prose
  that gets materialized into every matching run's worktree and pulled into
  the agent's context (`worker_runs.resolved_skills` records which): they
  bloat that context and can contradict each other, so the epic keeps them
  on the slower human path. `standing_orders` is operator-applied
  for a different reason: it's coordinator-facing config (surfaced in `arb
  prime`, never injected into any worker prompt — see
  `ArbiterCli.ConfigSchema`), so there's no per-dispatch prompt effect to
  canary in the first place. A routing rule is numeric, bounded, trivially
  reversible, and directly measurable — which is why it goes first, and alone.

  ## The gate

  Nothing here runs unless the workspace sets

      loop.autonomous_routing_enabled: true

  It defaults to `false` on **every** workspace, including `default`. With the
  flag unset, `active/1` returns `nil`, the routing overlay is never consulted,
  and `tick/2` is `{:ok, :disabled}` — behaviour is byte-for-byte what it was
  before this module existed. Unsetting the flag mid-canary is the kill switch:
  the overlay stops on the very next dispatch, with no config unwinding needed.

  The kill switch is **terminal**, not a pause. The first `tick/2` after the
  flag goes away drops the `loop.canary` block (one write, once), because a
  paused canary is worse than no canary: while the flag is off both arms route
  identically, so every dispatch in that window is baseline in *both* arms. If
  the block survived, re-arming the flag would judge — and possibly promote —
  on a window that contains dispatches the canary never influenced. Re-enabling
  starts a clean canary with a fresh `started_at` instead.

  ## What is eligible

  A `PendingWrite` is eligible only when **all** of these hold (`eligible/1`):

    * it is `:proposed` — i.e. it already cleared the Stage 2 evidence bar and
      was escalated to the operator at least once. Autonomous application never
      lowers that bar, and never applies a finding the operator has not already
      seen as a Stage 2 proposal;
    * its evidence still clears the workspace's bar *on its own terms* — a
      `:task`-scoped row that bypassed the bar by blast radius is refused here,
      because a fleet-affecting routing change is not blast-radius 1;
    * it is a `:config_set` whose patch is exactly one `D<n>` tier's
      `model_tier` / `thinking` — no other config key, no second tier, no
      `unset_paths`;
    * its workspace routes `by_difficulty` (any other policy never reads
      `routing.rules`, so the canary would measure nothing).

  ## The canary

  `start/3` writes a `loop.canary` block to the workspace config — it does
  **not** write `routing.rules`. The rule is instead overlaid at dispatch time
  by `Arbiter.Agents.Routing.ByDifficulty`, and only for tasks in the canary
  arm (`arm/2`): a stable 50/50 split of task ids, salted with the proposal id.
  Alternating dispatches, rather than the repo-selection layer, because
  `Routing.choose/3` is not given the dispatch's repo — the arm has to be
  derivable from what routing actually has in hand, and from what
  `worker_runs` records afterwards, or the measurement and the application
  would disagree about who was in which arm.

  A task's `#review` / `#impl` runs hash into the same arm as the task itself,
  so a canaried task is never half-canaried.

  ## The verdict

  `evaluate/2` compares the two arms over the runs recorded since the canary
  started (`Arbiter.Loop.Canary.Metrics`):

    * **first-pass ReviewGate convergence** — the fraction of reviewed tasks
      whose round-1 review approved with nothing left unmet. This is the
      target metric;
    * **cost per review round** — reported alongside, never the trigger.

  No verdict is returned before the canary arm has at least 20 dispatches
  (`min_dispatches`, floor-clamped — a workspace may raise it, never lower it).
  At current fleet volume that is a multi-day window by design, not an instant
  flip. It is not, however, an *unbounded* one: a canary that has not gathered
  its sample within `loop.canary_max_age_days` (default 14) expires — the block
  is dropped, the proposal is soft-rejected with the reason, and the operator is
  mailed. A tier too quiet to measure must not keep an unvalidated rule live on
  half of its dispatches forever.

  Then:

    * canary convergence **below** control (beyond `regression_tolerance`,
      default `0.0`) → `:revert`. The canary block is removed, the proposal is
      soft-rejected with the measurement attached, and nothing was ever written
      to `routing.rules` — so the revert is a deletion, not a repair;
    * otherwise → `:promote`. The rule lands on `routing.rules.D<n>` for the
      whole workspace and the proposal moves to `:applied`.

  Both outcomes are a `paper_trail` version on `Workspace` with `actor` set to
  `loop:proposal:<id>`, so `arb workspace history` shows exactly which proposal
  moved the routing table and when it was taken back.
