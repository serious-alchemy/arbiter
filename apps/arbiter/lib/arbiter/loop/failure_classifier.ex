defmodule Arbiter.Loop.FailureClassifier do
  @moduledoc """
  Segment a failed `worker_runs` row into an analysis class — the critical
  first step of the Stage 1 loop-analysis pass (bd-dyfaq3, epic #1011).

  A naive pass pointed at `status = failed` spends its whole budget learning
  about our own deploy restarts: `server restarted` is the modal failure by a
  wide margin. So failures are segmented by an **allowlist, not a heuristic**,
  into:

    * `:operational`  — server restarts, rate-limits, auth failures, merge/CI
      infra, review-timeouts, and **spawn failures** (`worker spawn failed
      after registration: ...`, and the `:inspect_worktree_failed` /
      `:fetch_failed` / `:worktree_failed` tags it wraps — #1220). A spawn
      failure happens after worker registration but before any agent starts:
      no prompt, no model call, no transcript, so it carries zero
      agent-quality signal by construction and must never fall through to
      `:unclassified`. Route to ops; **never** to prompt changes.
    * `:agent_quality` — `:review_gate_rejected`, "never signalled `arb done`",
      `:uncommitted_at_completion`, `:no_commits_at_completion`,
      `:secret_in_commit`, and **context exhaustion**. These are the only
      failures a prompt/skill change can move.
    * `:excluded`      — corpus noise (`:simulated_failure`) that must not
      pollute any denominator.
    * `:unknown`       — a reason nobody allowlisted. Surfaced, **never**
      silently bucketed as operational.

  ## `failure_reason` is a hint, not ground truth

  The label lies. The proof is this task's own first attempt — run
  `c88c77b0-2927-41ec-b582-6210538a43b3` was recorded
  `failure_reason: "agent was rate-limited / the API was overloaded"`, but its
  transcript contains no 429, no overload, no quota error — only an autocompact
  thrash and a bare `claude session error`. The true cause was **context
  exhaustion**: an agent with no read discipline burning its own window. Taken
  at face value the label files it *operational → drop it*, hiding the purest
  agent-quality signal in the corpus behind ops noise.

  So `classify/2` takes the transcript's terminal lines and **corroborates**:

    * Context exhaustion is detected from the transcript
      (`context_exhaustion?/1`) — an autocompact-thrash message, or a
      `claude session error` with no genuine API error — **regardless of the
      label**, and reclassifies an operational label to
      `:agent_quality`/`:context_exhaustion`.
    * A *genuine* API error payload (`api_error_signal?/1`) — not the word
      "rate" or "quota" appearing in source the worker was merely reading —
      corroborates an operational rate-limit label and is left operational.

  Every result carries `label_class` (what the label alone said),
  `reclassified?`, `corroborated?`, and `corroboration`
  (`:agree | :disagree | :unavailable`) so the pass can report the
  label-vs-transcript **disagreement rate** as a first-class corpus-integrity
  finding rather than silently correcting it.

  ## Structured evidence beats a tail regex (bd-apwfmy)

  `context_exhaustion?/1` and friends are *re-derivations*.
  `Arbiter.Worker.StopReason` already classified the death **typed**, at the
  moment it happened, with the whole captured output in hand — and Arbiter
  then kept only the English sentence it renders (`reason.summary` becomes
  `failure_reason`). Persisting the typed `category` alongside it
  (`worker_runs.stop_category`) turns the corroboration into a lookup instead
  of a scan.

  So `classify/3` takes an optional `:stop_category` and, when it is one of the
  **unambiguous** categories in `@stop_category_map`, uses it directly and
  reports `evidence: :stop_category` — no transcript needed. Categories that
  genuinely carry no verdict (`:crashed`, `:stalled` — "non-zero exit, no
  recognized signature") deliberately fall through to the transcript/label
  path rather than manufacturing false precision.

  `evidence` names which path produced the verdict (`:stop_category` /
  `:transcript` / `:label`), so the pass can report how much of a window it
  still had to text-mine. `corroborated` means "evidence beyond the label was
  available" — now true for a structured verdict with no transcript at all, so
  the disagreement rate keeps its denominator while the transcript reads go
  away.
