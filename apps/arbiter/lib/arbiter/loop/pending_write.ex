defmodule Arbiter.Loop.PendingWrite do
  @moduledoc """
  A **reviewable proposal** produced by the loop-analysis pass (Stage 2 of the
  loop-engineering epic, bd-9j2g3x).

  Stage 1 (`Arbiter.Loop.Analysis`) computes suggestions and prints them. They
  existed only in stdout, so next week's pass recomputed from a fresh window
  with no memory that a finding had ever been raised — and a below-bar finding
  (correctly declined at n=1) was discarded entirely, so its third occurrence
  three weeks later started counting from zero.

  A `PendingWrite` is that suggestion, persisted. It is **inert**: a queued row
  is not an effect. Nothing is ever auto-applied at any evidence level — an
  operator applies or rejects it through `Arbiter.Loop`.

  ## States

    * `:hypothesis` — recorded, but below the evidence bar. Accumulates
      evidence across windows; not applicable.
    * `:proposed` — cleared the bar (or is `:task`-scoped, blast-radius 1).
      Applicable, and escalated to the coordinator mailbox exactly once.
    * `:applied` — an operator applied it; `applied_at` is stamped.
    * `:rejected` — an operator declined it. **Soft**: the row persists so the
      same finding is not re-proposed from scratch, and later windows keep
      reinforcing its evidence in place.
    * `:superseded` — replaced by a later proposal.

  Rows are never deleted (invariant 3: never delete, archive), so this resource
  deliberately has no `:destroy` action.

  ## Cross-window accumulation

  `fingerprint` is a deterministic digest of `{kind, target, category,
  difficulty, repo}` — never an LLM comparison. A later window that produces
  the same fingerprint **reinforces** the existing row (unions `incident_refs`
  / `task_refs`, recomputes `evidence_count` / `distinct_tasks`) instead of
  inserting a duplicate. The partial unique index over `(fingerprint, state)`
  restricted to the two live states is the database-level backstop.

  ## Pre-registration

  `target_metric` and `baseline` are copied from the suggestion and recorded
  **before** the change is applied, so the goalposts cannot move afterwards.
  They are refreshed while the row is still un-applied (each window remeasures
  the same baseline) and frozen once `state` is `:applied`.

  `outcome_delta` / `outcome_checked_at` are **reserved** here and populated by
  the follow-up re-grading pass — not by this resource or by `Arbiter.Loop`.
