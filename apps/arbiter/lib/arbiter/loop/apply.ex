defmodule Arbiter.Loop.Apply do
  @moduledoc """
  Applying a queued loop proposal, as four named steps.

      validate/1     may this row be applied at all?
      side_effect/2  do the thing, through the same public domain API a
                     human would use
      persist/2      move the row to :applied
      notify/1       announce the state change

  `run/2` is those four in order, and is what `Arbiter.Loop.apply_pending/2`
  calls. They are public individually (bd-3b7svv) because this is the *only*
  code path that turns a proposal into a real change to a skill, a workspace's
  config, a task's difficulty, or a repo's `CLAUDE.md` — and the queue's
  no-auto-apply discipline is a property of `validate/1` specifically, which is
  worth asserting without also provisioning the write it guards.

  A fifth function, `payload_ready?/1` (bd-bldypb), answers a narrower
  question read-only: does this row's payload have what its kind's
  `side_effect/2` clause needs, before ever fetching the skill/task/workspace
  it targets or writing anything? It shares its per-kind extraction with
  `side_effect/2` — the private `*_args/1` functions below — so the listing
  (`arb loop pending`) and the apply path cannot drift on what "applicable"
  means.

  Two rules the ordering encodes, and that the split makes checkable:

    * **The side effect runs before the row is marked.** A failed apply leaves
      the proposal `:proposed`, so it can be retried once the gap is closed —
      it is never silently consumed.
    * **The change is attributed to the proposal, not to the operator.**
      `attribution/1` produces `loop:proposal:<id>`, so reading the target's
      version history shows exactly which queued proposal moved it. The
      operator rides along separately as the Ash actor on `persist/2`.

  the skill/task/workspace the row targets or writes anything, and only
  that: no DB lookup, no side effect, no state change on `row`.

  This is *not* `Loop.inapplicable_reason/1` — that answers whether the
  row's current *state* (`:proposed` vs. `:hypothesis`) allows applying it
  at all. This answers whether the payload it carries has enough in it to
  apply, regardless of state. Sharing the extraction functions with
  `side_effect/2` is what keeps the two from ever disagreeing about what
  "applicable" means.
