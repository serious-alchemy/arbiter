defmodule Arbiter.CircuitBreaker do
  @moduledoc """
  A single shared circuit breaker for every auto-filing / auto-escalating /
  auto-redispatching path in the fleet (bd-5jr49o, #1632).

  ## Why this exists

  One defect used to become N tickets, because every failure handler grew its
  own bound — or none at all. In one month, 33 duplicate filings were 10.3% of
  the backlog:

    * bd-7rxwzc — one unresolvable `repo` re-filed a PRPatrol follow-up per
      backoff window: 22 tickets.
    * bd-8lnnnt — 14 identical pre-flight auth escalations in 75 minutes.
    * bd-6bg54c — 303+ Watchdog retries, an escalation roughly every 30 minutes.
    * bd-brwx7w — two undeduplicated pollers escalating the same merge block
      about once a minute, indefinitely.

  Each was fixed case-specifically, and the next handler re-learned the lesson
  (PRPatrol's re-file loop recurred 27 days after its first fix). This module is
  the generic version: one primitive, adopted at every such path, so a new
  handler inherits the bound instead of re-deriving it.

  ## Semantics

  Keyed by **signature** = workspace + kind + normalised subject (see
  `Arbiter.CircuitBreaker.Signature`). For one signature:

    * the first `K` triggers inside the window are **allowed**;
    * the `K+1`-th trips the breaker: the action is **suppressed**, and exactly
      **one** coordinator escalation is emitted naming the signature, the count
      and the window;
    * while open, every further trigger is suppressed silently — no second
      escalation, no action;
    * the breaker closes when a full window passes with **no** trigger at all,
      or when the coordinator resets it (`breaker_reset` MCP tool /
      `arb breaker reset`). A sustained flood therefore keeps it open for as
      long as the flood lasts, which is exactly the bd-brwx7w shape; a
      condition that genuinely resolves and later recurs pages again.

  Note that suppressed triggers refresh the window. "Open until the window
  expires" means *quiet* for a window, not *K triggers ago*: a poller firing
  once a minute against a 1-hour window never re-opens the floodgates.

  ## Fail-open

  Every failure mode here — breaker process down, escalation write failing,
  normalisation raising — resolves to `:allow`. A broken breaker must never be
  the reason a genuine alert is swallowed; over-paging is recoverable, silence
  is not.

  ## State is in-memory

  Counters live in this GenServer, not the database. A restart closes every
  breaker, which is the right default: a restart is exactly the kind of
  intervention that may have fixed the underlying condition, and the flood
  re-establishes the breaker within K triggers. `call_sites/0` is static, so
  `arb breaker list` still enumerates every adopted path on a freshly-booted
  server, with live counters for whichever have fired since boot.

  ## What is deliberately NOT on this primitive

  `Arbiter.Workflows.ReviewPatrol` keeps its own breakers (#1548's per-engagement
  loop signature, #1572's per-finding refutation tracking). Those are not
  count-in-window suppressors at all: they trip on a *semantic* predicate about
  one engagement — a repeat verdict on an unchanged SHA, a re-request disputing
  a standing verdict, blocking findings already answered on lines the push did
  not touch. There is no K and no window to port, so moving them here would
  rewrite their behaviour rather than refactor it. They sit alongside this
  module, not on it.

  ## Usage

      case CircuitBreaker.check(:pr_patrol_follow_up, [repo, pr_number],
             workspace_id: ws_id, task_ref: task.id) do
        :allow -> file_the_ticket()
        {:suppress, _info} -> :suppressed
      end

  or, when the action is a plain function:

      CircuitBreaker.guard(:my_kind, subject, [workspace_id: ws], fn -> ... end)

  # Bounds are deliberately per-kind rather than global. Filing a ticket is
  # expensive and near-irreversible (a human closes it), so PRPatrol gets a tight
  # bound over a long window. Posting a coordinator escalation is cheap and is
  # the last line of defence behind four other breakers, so it gets a loose one —
