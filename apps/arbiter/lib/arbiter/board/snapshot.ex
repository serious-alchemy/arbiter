defmodule Arbiter.Board.Snapshot do
  @moduledoc """
  The board, derived. One read of the world in, five columns and a dispatch
  decision out.

  The operator console's board is not a stored object — Arbiter has no "board"
  table and deliberately doesn't want one. Every column is a *view* of state
  that already exists (issues, live workers, merge requests), so the board can
  never drift from the system it describes: there is nothing to keep in sync.

  ## The five columns

  Every ticket's column comes from one projection, `Arbiter.Tasks.Lifecycle.view/2`
  (bd-6zapbl), mapped onto these five until the seven-column board lands
  (bd-79w1fs) by `Arbiter.Tasks.Lifecycle.board_column/2`. The same call
  classifies the epic mini-board (`classify_columns/3`) and the `/epics`
  rollup (`Arbiter.Tasks.EpicRollup`), so the three cannot disagree. Each card
  builder below only builds cards for tickets in its own column, so a ticket
  lands in exactly one.

    * **Backlog** — `:backlog` tickets: filed, not refined. Newest first,
      deliberately: an unrefined pile is a to-think-about list, not a queue,
      and ordering it by priority would imply a ranking the refinement hasn't
      earned.
    * **Ready** — `:queued` tickets, Blocked and Ready alike. A real queue,
      ordered by priority then age, each card carrying the reason
      `Arbiter.Board.Scheduler` gave it (`next up — dispatching...`,
      `2 ahead in queue`, `blocked — waiting on bd-9`). A leftover
      `:completed` or `:failed` author row does not hide a queued ticket: the
      column is the ticket's, not the run's.
    * **Running** — `:in_progress` tickets whose primary author run is live:
      `:idle`, `:resuming`, `:running`, and `:awaiting_review_gate` (parked
      while a *reviewer agent* reads the diff — automated, so still the
      machine's turn). Reviewer workers fold into the author's card rather
      than occupying one of their own; a review is a phase of the author's
      work, not a second piece of it. An in-progress ticket whose run has not
      registered yet (inside the dispatch grace) is a "dispatching" card here.
    * **Waiting** — `:merging` and `:verifying` tickets, plus an
      `:in_progress` ticket whose author run is done and whose outcome now
      depends on something outside it: `:awaiting` (it asked a human a
      question), `:failed` (parked; send it back or close it) and
      `:awaiting_review` (an MR is open and the Watchdog is polling) — or that
      has **no live worker at all** past the dispatch grace (e.g. `arb worker
      stop` on an `:awaiting_review` worker, the documented pre-flight for
      `arb server deploy`), which always flags `needs_you` since nothing will
      retry it on its own. Longest wait first, because a stalled card is the
      thing worth seeing.
    * **Closed · last 24h** — `:closed` tickets closed in the last 24 hours
      (rolling window, keyed on `closed_at`). The day's evidence of progress,
      and the only column with no action on it.

  Epics are excluded from every column (bd-38of5i): the evidence of a day's
  progress is the children that closed, not the container that closed because
  they did, and an epic reaches the board only as the `↳` chip a child card
  carries.

  ## Backlog, and why Blocked is not a separate column (yet)

  Refinement and dependency-readiness are orthogonal questions: a refined
  card whose blocker is still open is `:blocked` in the lifecycle, and on this
  interim board it stays in Ready carrying its own `blocked — waiting on
  bd-9` reason. A blocker is satisfied once it is `:verifying` or `:closed` —
  verifying unblocks dependents (`Arbiter.Tasks.Lifecycle.blocker_satisfied?/1`).

  ## Waiting, and the needs-you flag

  Waiting used to be two columns — Needs you and Merge queue — which split
  cards by *what* they wait on: a person, or a poll. That is not the split an
  operator acts on. Every card in the column is equally out of the worker's
  hands; the only question that changes what a human does next is whether the
  system has anything left to try on its own.

  So it is one column, and that narrower signal rides on the card as
  `:needs_you`:

    * `:awaiting` always flags — the worker asked a question, and there is no
      such thing as retrying a question.
    * `:failed` always flags — a parked worker is terminal by definition, so
      whatever it was last seen waiting on, nothing is going to turn it.
    * an open MR flags unless its block is one the Watchdog still resolves by
      itself — `:behind_base` (it rebases) and `:ci_failed` (it dispatches a
      fix pass). Everything else, from `:conflict` to `:needs_approval` to
      `:draft`, waits on a person; an unblocked MR is simply mid-review, which
      is still the machine's turn.

  The block reason is read through `Arbiter.Worker.Watchdog`
  (`effective_block_reason/1`, itself gated on `classify/1 == :approved`), the
  same surface the merge-queue screen reads, so the flag can never disagree
  with the status text rendered next to it. The exempt list is the Watchdog's
  own `auto_resolvable?/1` set rather than a hand-kept roster of human blocks,
  so it *shrinks* as more auto-recovery lands and a newly-invented block
  reason defaults to "a person's" instead of silently reading as pipeline
  wait. It measures "still needs a human today", not "something is imperfect".

  A worker at `:awaiting_review` holds an MR, not a subprocess — no agent is
  burning quota for it — but it still occupies its task's *slot* (bd-45pwo1):
  the operator's rule is "another slot doesn't open until the issue occupying
  it is merged", and an open MR is not merged. `slots_free` means "tasks I
  could start dispatching right now given the cap", which is a different
  number from `agents_live`, "agents actually burning quota this instant" —
  see `Arbiter.Tasks.SlotGate`'s "A slot is a task, not an agent" section.

  ## Deriving vs loading

  `derive/1` is pure: hand it issues, worker snapshots and a clock and it
  computes the board, including the dispatch plan. `load/1` is the thin shell
  that reads those inputs from the repo, the worker supervisor, the settings
  and the quota gate. All the interesting rules live in the pure half, so the
  board's behaviour is testable without a database.

  implementation the `dispatch/2` quota seam uses (bd-5j6nmn), so Autopilot's
  one-per-tick promotion gate and the dispatcher agree on the same underlying
  data.

  A `:continue`-mode workspace (`Arbiter.Quota.continue_mode?/1`) never holds
  here: the `dispatch/2` seam is the single choke point for the allow/overage decision,
  so the board must not show a `blocked — quota exhausted` hold that the
  dispatcher itself would not honor (reviewer round 1, finding 1).

  An open `Arbiter.Agents.AuthHold` on the workspace's default agent provider
  (bd-21bmdh — N consecutive workers died on auth) rides the same board-wide
  hold, ahead of the quota window and regardless of `:continue` mode: the
  dispatcher's auth guard refuses those dispatches unconditionally, so
  `Arbiter.Board.Autopilot` must not keep promoting a card only to have it
  refused. This is what stops a reopened auth-failed task from being
  re-attempted every tick while credentials are dead.

  # ---- shared column classification -----------------------------------------

  @doc """
  The board's own column classification, applied to an arbitrary set of
  issues rather than the whole board.

  Design bd-2s901b §3: an epic detail page groups its children into a
  "Children by status" mini-board using these same five columns, so it needs
  the same answer the board itself would give. Since bd-6zapbl both read it
  from `Arbiter.Tasks.Lifecycle.board_column/2` — the ticket's
  `Lifecycle.view/2` column through the interim five-column mapping — and
  so does `Arbiter.Tasks.EpicRollup`.

  `workers` need only be the live workers for these issues' ids (a caller
  scoped to one epic's children has no reason to pass the whole fleet); they
  are the runs the projection reads. Unlike the board, an epic child gets a
  column here too — a sub-epic still belongs on its parent's mini-board.

  Options: `:now` (the dispatch-grace clock, default now) and `:blocked_by`
  (issue id → unsatisfied blocker ids, which only splits Blocked from Ready
  and so cannot move a card between these five columns).

  Returns `%{issue_id => :backlog | :ready | :running | :waiting | :closed}`.

  #     dispatched into. Past the grace it reads as *orphaned* instead, and
  #     releases the mutex: nothing is going to retry it on its own, so holding
  #     its counterpart hostage would strand both.
  #   * a reviewer / implementer worker, claiming on behalf of the author it
  #     works for — covers a fix pass whose author worker has already gone.
  #   * the author's own live worker, which knows its status exactly.
  #
  # A counterpart that is `:closed`, parked at `:awaiting_verification`
  # (merged — the worktree is gone, nothing left to collide with) or `:failed`
