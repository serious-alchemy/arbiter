defmodule Arbiter.Board.Autopilot do
  @moduledoc """
  The process that actually promotes. `Arbiter.Board.Scheduler` decides *which*
  Ready card should go next; this is the thing that goes and dispatches it.

  The board's Ready column is a queue, not a staging area — the handoff's
  "drop to dispatch" zone is deliberately not built (bd-bqyeqa). An operator
  who has to drag every card into Running is a scheduler made of a person, and
  a person is the one component in this system that cannot watch sixteen slots
  at once. So the queue drains itself: on each tick the autopilot reads the
  board, and if `Arbiter.Board.Snapshot` named a card to promote, it dispatches
  exactly that one card.

  ## One card per tick

  `Scheduler.plan/1` promotes at most one card even when several slots are
  free, and this process does not loop to catch up. Dispatch is slow and has
  side effects — a worktree, a branch, possibly a paid agent session — and a
  card that has just been dispatched does not appear as in-flight work until
  its worker registers. Promoting one card per tick means the next tick reads a
  world that already contains the previous promotion, so file-overlap and slot
  accounting stay honest without this module having to model in-flight
  dispatches itself.

  ## Dispatch runs off the process

  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.dispatch/1` provisions a worktree, spawns an agent
  subprocess and attaches a workflow machine — seconds to minutes. Running that
  inside `handle_info/2` would make this GenServer unavailable for the whole of
  a promotion, and the promotion is exactly what makes every open board ask it
  a question: `Worker.init/1` broadcasts `:started` mid-dispatch, boards
  refresh on that, and their calls would time out against a process busy doing
  the thing they are refreshing to show.

  So a promotion runs in a supervised `Task` and this process stays a
  bookkeeper: `:dispatching` holds the one in-flight promotion, `tick/2`
  callers are parked with `GenServer.reply/2` until the task reports back, and
  `pause/1`, `paused?/1` and `board/2` keep answering the whole time. One
  promotion at a time still holds — a tick that arrives mid-dispatch answers
  `{:busy, id}` rather than starting a second one.

  ## Paused by default, persisted after that (bd-pgi97m)

  The autopilot starts paused unless the install opts in
  (`config :arbiter, :board_autopilot, enabled: true`, or `paused: false` at
  start). Auto-dispatch spends money and touches a git worktree; a fresh
  install should not discover it by finding four agents running.

  Once an operator has explicitly paused or resumed via any path
  (`pause/2` / `resume/2` — MCP, `arb scheduler`, the REST API, or a dashboard
  toggle), that choice is persisted to `Arbiter.Settings`
  (`installation_settings.board_autopilot_paused`) and `init/1` reads it back
  on the next start, so a restart resumes the install's last choice instead of
  always coming back paused. A fresh install with nothing persisted still
  falls back to the app-env default above. Persisting is best-effort: a write
  failure (e.g. no DB connection, as in a bare unit test) is logged and
  swallowed rather than blocking the in-memory pause/resume, which always
  takes effect immediately either way.

  While paused the board still renders a full plan — every Ready card reads
  `scheduler paused` rather than a queue position, because a position implies
  a queue that is moving.

  ## Deferred resumes go first (bd-92mx1m)

  A task that released its slot — parked for a human, completed, stopped — and
  is then resumed must re-acquire one (`Arbiter.Worker.ResumeSlot`). When an
  *automatic* resume (the boot reconciler, a Watchdog auto-resume, a
  MergeQueue revise) finds the cap full, `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch` neither
  fails it nor lets it go over: it hands it here with `defer_resume/4`, and
  this process replays it — `Dispatch.resume/2` or `resume_session/2` with the
  caller's own options plus `slot_admitted: true` — on the first pass that
  sees a free slot.

  A deferred resume is work already in progress, so it goes **ahead of** every
  Ready card: while one is queued, no Ready card is promoted. For the same
  reason a pause does not hold it back — a pause stops *new* board dispatches
  and nothing else (`Arbiter.Board.Drain`). Queued resumes drain in arrival
  order, one per pass like a promotion; a second deferral of the same task
  replaces the options but keeps its place. A replay that finds the task
  already resumed, closed or gone is dropped quietly; any other failure is
  escalated once and dropped — the queue never retries it on its own.

  The queue is in memory. A restart loses it, which is the same thing the
  restart does to everything else in flight: the boot reconciler re-resumes
  mid-flight tasks, and the patrols re-watch open PRs.

  ## The fast lane: a ticket returning from Merging (bd-741sid)

  The same queue carries the runs of a ticket coming back from Merging — a CI
  fix pass (`:fix_pass`) or a conflict pass (`:conflict`) its Watchdog asked
  for. A Merging ticket holds no slot, so the pass must get one
  (`Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.PassAdmission`); at a full cap it is queued
  here and replayed through its dispatcher (`FixPassDispatcher.dispatch/1` /
  `ConflictResolver.resolve/1`) with `slot_admitted: true` the moment a slot
  frees — ahead of every Ready ticket, exactly like a deferred resume.

  ## A dispatch that keeps failing gets escalated (bd-a40f4q)

  `finish_dispatch/3`'s log-and-move-on above is right for a card's *first*
  failure — it might be transient, and the next tick re-reads a world that
  may have changed. It stops being right once the same card keeps failing the
  same way tick after tick: nothing distinguishes "hasn't been picked up yet"
  from "will never dispatch until a human intervenes," and the only trace is
  a `Logger.warning` line that this fleet's own experience says is not a
  reliable place to notice it after the fact.

  So `state.failures` tracks, per card id, the shape of its most recent
  dispatch error and how many consecutive ticks have produced that same
  shape. A handful of error classes — `:ambiguous_repo`, `:no_repo_configured`,
  `:repo_not_found` — are deterministic: retrying dispatch can never change
  the answer, so they escalate to the coordinator inbox on the very first
  occurrence. Every other shape gets a small retry budget first, in case it
  is transient (a quota gate, a network blip), and only escalates once that
  budget is exhausted. Either way, escalating is a one-shot latch per
  (card, error shape): once sent, it does not repeat on every tick — a
  successful dispatch or a change in error shape is what re-arms it. See
  `Arbiter.Messages.CoordinatorNotifier.dispatch_stuck/3`.

  ## A quota-exhausted pre-flight failure is held, not retried every tick (bd-8lnnnt)

  Historical: this held a `:quota_exhausted` `Arbiter.Worker.StopReason` that
  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.run_preflight/2`'s per-dispatch auth probe could
  produce. bd-2jgs2h retired that probe (see
  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch`'s moduledoc and `docs/quota-and-auth.md`) — `dispatch/2`
  now only ever produces `:auth_expired` on this path, so the `retry_not_before`
  branch below is currently unreachable from a real dispatch. It is kept
  because the autopilot tests still feed a `:quota_exhausted` shape in by hand
  to exercise `record_failure/3` and `promote_or_hold/2` directly, and because
  `Arbiter.Workflows.DispatchQueue` may still produce that shape via its own
  path (see its moduledoc). If some other producer of `:quota_exhausted`
  reappears here, this hold still applies to it unchanged:

  Because that card never leaves Ready on a dispatch failure, and the window
  does not reset on Autopilot's 15s tick, every tick before a real quota-exhausted
  failure resets is otherwise a wasted retry destined to fail the identical
  way. `record_failure/3` computes a `retry_not_before` for this shape — the
  failure's own reported reset time when known, else a bounded exponential
  backoff — and `promote/1` honours it: the card stays the board's `promote:`
  pick (Scheduler has no notion of "skip this one"), but Autopilot declines to
  actually dispatch it until the hold clears, reporting `{:held, id,
  retry_not_before}` instead. `Arbiter.Messages.CoordinatorNotifier.preflight_failed/2`
  carries its own separate dedupe for the escalation itself, so this hold is
  about not re-attempting, not (only) about not re-paging.

  This hold only covers Autopilot's own periodic tick. It is **not** what
  drove the bd-7qbavq incident this bug tracks: that card's retries carried
  `skip_quota_gate: true` (a flag only `Arbiter.Workflows.DispatchQueue`'s
  drain sets — see `DispatchQueue`'s moduledoc), landed on 5-minute
  boundaries matching `Arbiter.Quota.CloudProbe`'s broadcast
  interval, and produced only one run row, all of which rule out this
  tick path. `DispatchQueue` carries the equivalent hold for the path
  that actually produced the flood; see its `retry_not_before` handling.

  ## Reactive triggers, not just a tick (bd-axgpec)

  A 15s tick made a closed task or a freed slot wait up to 15s for the next
  pass; slowing the fallback tick to 60s (configurable, `interval_ms` in
  `config :arbiter, :board_autopilot`) makes that wait too long to accept
  without a reactive path alongside it. So this process also subscribes to
  the PubSub topics that mean "the plan may now be stale":

    * `"tasks"` — `Arbiter.Tasks.Issue.broadcast_lifecycle/2`'s
      `{:task_lifecycle, event, issue}`, which covers a close, a promote to
      Ready, and a `depends_on`/`blocks`/`conflicts_with` edge add or remove
      (`Arbiter.Tasks.Dependencies` broadcasts on the same topic for both
      endpoints). The queue's order is priority, then the persisted `rank`
      (bd-asxw4e), so there is no session-only ordering to miss.
    * `"events"` (`Arbiter.Events`'s global topic) — `{:event, %{topic:
      "worker_done" | "worker_failed"}}`, meaning a slot just freed.

  Each trigger debounces (`debounce_ms`, default 300ms) rather than running
  immediately, so a burst — several tasks closing at once — yields one pass.
  A trigger that lands while a dispatch Task is already in flight does not
  queue a timer; it sets a flag instead, and that one deferred pass runs the
  moment the in-flight dispatch reports back, whatever the current debounce
  state is.

  A successful dispatch schedules an immediate follow-up pass of its own —
  no debounce — so several Ready cards with free slots behind them drain at
  dispatch speed rather than one per tick, matching the one-card-per-pass
  design above. A pass that finds nothing to promote (`:idle`, `:paused`,
  `:busy`, `:held`, or a dispatch failure with no trigger pending) does not
  reschedule itself — only an external trigger, or a dispatch that actually
  succeeded, ever schedules the next one. Without that asymmetry a quiet
  board with nothing to do would still tick itself forever at debounce
  speed.

  This is a real, accepted behaviour change from the pre-bd-axgpec, tick-only
  scheduler: with dead credentials and several Ready tasks behind free slots,
  a burst of successful-looking dispatches (a dispatch call "succeeds" in the
  sense of starting a worker; the worker then dies on its own auth check) can
  now happen back-to-back, up to `slots_free` deep, before `AuthHold` opens
  and the board-level hold takes over — instead of one attempt per 15s/60s
  tick. The number of such attempts stays bounded by the number of free
  slots, not unbounded, and `AuthHold`/`promote_or_hold/2` still cuts it off
  as soon as the threshold trips; only the attempts *before* that point land
  closer together. Suites that assert an exact tick-by-tick attempt count or
  outcome sequence against dead credentials should start Autopilot with
  `follow_up: false` (see `start_link/1`) to opt back into one pass per
  `tick/2` call, matching that pre-existing assumption.

  Quota holds lifting and a `retry_not_before` expiring are not PubSub
  events — nothing broadcasts when a clock crosses a deadline — so those
  stay on the fallback tick, which is why 60s is a compromise and not a
  formality: a hold that clears right after a pass can wait up to a minute
  before the tick notices. `promote_or_hold/2`'s hold logic is unchanged.
