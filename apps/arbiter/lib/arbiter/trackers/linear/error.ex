defmodule Arbiter.Trackers.Linear.Error do
  @moduledoc """
  Normalised error returned by every `Arbiter.Trackers.Linear` callback on
  failure. Mirrors the shape of `Arbiter.Trackers.GitHub.Error` and
  `Arbiter.Trackers.Jira.Error`.

  ## Kinds

    * `:unauthenticated` — 401, token missing/rejected
    * `:forbidden` — 403, scope/permission issue
    * `:not_found` — issue doesn't exist
    * `:validation_failed` — GraphQL rejected the input
    * `:server_error` — 5xx
    * `:http` — any other HTTP error
    * `:network` — transport-level failure
    * `:graphql_error` — the request succeeded (HTTP 200) but Linear returned
      `errors` in the response body
    * `:transition_not_found` — the requested tracker status had no mapping to a
      Linear workflow state in the team's state list
    * `:upstream_past_target` — a forward transition was declined because the
      item is already at, or beyond, the mapped state (bd-4i7kky);
      writing would move it backwards
    * `:config_missing` — workspace config is missing credentials or no active
      workspace is set
