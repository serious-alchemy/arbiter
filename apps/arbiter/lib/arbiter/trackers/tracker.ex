defmodule Arbiter.Trackers.Tracker do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for external issue-tracker adapters.

  An adapter implements this for one tracker backend (`Jira`, `Linear`,
  `GitHub`, or the trivial `None` stand-in). The `Arbiter.Trackers` helper
  resolves which adapter to use for a given task by reading
  `issue.tracker_type`.

  ## Callback semantics

    * `fetch/1` — pull the canonical record from the tracker. Shape is
      tracker-specific (a Jira issue map, a Linear node, etc.); callers should
      treat the result as opaque and use other callbacks to act on it.
    * `transition/2` — move the external item to a target status. The status
      atom uses the tracker vocabulary (`:open | :in_progress | :closed`, mapped
      from the ticket's `state` by `status_for_state/1`); each adapter maps it
      to its own state machine.
    * `update_fields/2` — patch fields on the external item. The fields map
      uses task-domain keys (`:title`, `:description`, ...); the
      adapter renames + format-converts (e.g. Markdown → ADF for Jira).
    * `link_for/1` — return a human-clickable URL for the ref. Used in CLI
      output and notifications.
    * `parse_ref/1` — best-effort parse of a user-supplied string into the
      adapter's canonical ref form (e.g. `"AX-17585"` for Jira). Returns
      `:error` if the string is clearly not for this tracker.
    * `list_transitions/1` — return the set of legal next-states from the
      current state, as tracker-vocabulary atoms.
    * `list_open/1` — return open items in the tracker that look "claimable"
      by the active workspace's user (assignment is the claim signal). Used
      by `arb list --tracker` to surface upstream backlog alongside local
      tasks. Adapters that don't have a notion of a backlog return
      `{:error, :not_supported}`.
    * `create/1` — create a new issue in the tracker from the given attrs
      and return the canonical `ref`. Used by `arb create` to mirror a new
      task into the configured tracker. Attrs use task-domain keys
      (`:title`, `:description`, `:status`); each adapter
      translates to its own field names. Adapters that don't support
      outbound creation return `{:error, :not_supported}`.
    * `add_remote_link/3` — attach an external link (typically the PR/MR that
      implements the ticket) to the tracked item so the ticket references the
      code. **Optional** — adapters that have no notion of remote links simply
      don't implement it, and `Arbiter.Trackers.add_remote_link/3` returns
      `{:error, :not_supported}` for them. The Jira adapter implements it via
      the issue `remotelink` endpoint.

  ## `create` attrs shape

      %{
        title: "Wire the thing",
        description: "...",        # optional, Markdown
        status: :open,             # optional, default :open
        priority: 2,               # optional, integer 0..4 (task priority scale)
        issue_type: "bug"          # optional, free-form type string
      }

  ## `list_open` shape

  Each adapter normalizes its native payload into the same summary map so the
  CLI doesn't need to know which tracker produced the row:

      %{
        ref: "42",                           # canonical ref, as produced by parse_ref
        title: "Wire the thing",
        url: "https://github.com/o/r/issues/42",
        status: :open | :in_progress | :closed,
        assignees: ["alice", "bob"],
        raw: %{...}                          # the original tracker payload, for debugging
      }

  Options are a keyword list. Currently recognized:

    * `:assignee` — `:viewer` (default; means "the workspace's authenticated
      user") or a tracker-specific login string. Adapters may ignore this if
      they have no way to apply it.

  Tracker-vocabulary status / lifecycle-event atoms passed to `transition/2`.

  `:open | :in_progress | :closed` are the upstream item's statuses — a
  ticket's `state` maps onto them via `status_for_state/1`. The remaining
  atoms are richer lifecycle moments that don't map to a ticket state but still
  drive an external workflow (e.g. Jira's AX board): `:pr_opened` (PR opened
  for review), `:approved_unmerged` (review approved but parked, not merged),
  and `:merged` (PR merged). Adapters that don't model an event simply leave it
  unmapped, and the sync layer skips it.

  Return the fields the tracker *gates* the transition mapped from `status` on
  — the fields the provider requires populated before it will accept the

  requires, so the gate stays correct without any provider-specific logic
  leaking up into the workflow/sync layer.

  The sync layer uses this to push the task's produced values into the gating
  fields *before* attempting the transition, and to escalate — naming the exact
  missing field — when a required field has no produced value.

  Returns `{:ok, []}` when the transition isn't gated (the common case). A
  benign "this tracker doesn't model that event" reason (e.g.
  `:status_unmapped`) is returned as `{:error, reason}` and the sync layer
  treats it as "no gate" (there's no transition to gate).
