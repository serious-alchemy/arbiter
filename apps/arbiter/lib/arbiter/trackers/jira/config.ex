defmodule Arbiter.Trackers.Jira.Config do
  @moduledoc """
  Reads the Jira tracker configuration from the active workspace.

  ## Resolution order

    1. Process dict (`put_active/1`) — set by request lifecycles or tests.
    2. `Application.get_env(:arbiter, :jira_default_config)` — a static
       fallback for tools that don't carry a workspace (e.g. a CLI escript
       or a Mix task seeded from env vars).
    3. Neither → `{:error, %Error{kind: :config_missing}}`.

  this should be avoided outside of tests.

  # Default multi-hop transition graph for Acme's AX (Apex) workflow,
  # keyed by SOURCE status name. Each edge declares the status the hop lands on;
  # `"transition"` is an optional hint, used only to break a tie when several
  # live transitions land on that same status. The graph is therefore a *route*,
  # and `Jira.execute_path/3` resolves each hop against the live `/transitions`
  # response by destination status. This matters because Jira workflows — and
  # so transition *names* — can differ per issue type on one project: the
  # Backlog -> To Do move is "To do next" on a Story/Bug but "Ready to work (2)"
  # on a Task, and a name-matched graph silently failed to move Tasks
  # (bd-bwwkvr). Only multi-hop targets need a graph entry — a target
  # reachable by a single live transition is resolved directly from the
  # `/transitions` response (its `to` field), no graph required.
  #
  # The names below come from the AX *Story/Bug* workflow discovery in bd-c4cfuv
  # and are retained purely as tie-break hints — they are no longer required to
  # match. Transition ids are deliberately NOT used: ids collide across issue
  # types with opposite meanings on this project (id 131 is "Ready to work (2)"
  # -> To Do on a Task but "Won't complete" -> Closed on a Story), so resolving
  # by id would close tickets it meant to advance.
  #
  # Destination matching fixes hops whose *name* was wrong; it cannot conjure a
  # route that doesn't exist. `Code Complete -> Done` is one such: no AX
  # transition from Code Complete lands on Done at all — the only forward edge
  # is "Release branch cut" -> Release Ready for QA, and reaching Done means
  # traversing the whole deploy pipeline. The fabricated edge is therefore NOT
  # listed below; the shipped `closed => "Done"` mapping fails from Code
  # Complete with the honest `:no_transition_path` ("the graph has no route")
  # rather than a `:transition_unavailable` that implies the route is merely
  # stale. Mapping the real deploy-pipeline route is bd-c4cfuv.
  #
  # A workspace whose workflow routes through different *statuses* overrides
  # this via `tracker.config.transition_graph`.
  #
  # The graph also tells a `:closed` transition which statuses are still *before*
  # an intermediate closed target (bd-4i7kky): a status counts only when it sits
  # on a forward route from a status the `status_map` places tickets in. List
  # forward edges only — a rework edge (`"QA" => In Progress`) leaves QA outside
  # that route, so a ticket in QA is not dragged back to "Code Complete".
