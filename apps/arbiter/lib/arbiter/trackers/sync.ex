defmodule Arbiter.Trackers.Sync do
  @moduledoc """
  Loud, escalation-raising orchestration for external-tracker lifecycle sync.

  Two entry points, both tracker-agnostic:

    * `lifecycle/3` — drive a richer lifecycle moment that isn't a ticket state
      change (PR opened, review approved-but-parked). It seeds the adapter
      config from the task's workspace, transitions the external item toward
      the mapped target status (multi-hop path-finding lives in the adapter),
      and — for `:pr_opened` — attaches the PR as a comment + remote link.

    * `notify_failure/3` — the shared failure surface. The original incident
      (AX-17911 never auto-transitioned) was invisible because tracker errors
      were silently swallowed. This logs loudly **and** raises an
      escalation so a `status_map` / workflow mismatch can't hide.

  ## Benign vs. loud

  Not every non-`:ok` is a problem. A tracker that simply doesn't model a given
  lifecycle event (e.g. GitHub has no "In Code Review") returns
  `:status_unmapped` / `:transition_not_found` / `:not_supported` — we skip
  quietly. A *mapped* status that can't be reached (`:no_transition_path`) or a
  real wire failure (auth, 5xx, network) is loud + escalation. See `loud?/1`.

  ## Already-at-target-state recovery

  A `:validation_failed` from the tracker is normally loud, but it can be a
  benign race: e.g. GitHub auto-closes an issue via a `Closes #N` keyword
  between Arbiter's pre-flight GET (which saw "open") and the subsequent PATCH.
  `do_transition/2` re-fetches the upstream item after a `validation_failed` and
  suppresses the escalation if the item is already at the desired state — the
  transition was a no-op, not a real failure.

  ## Idempotency of the retried call (bd-1wplms)

  Only `:rate_limited` failures are retried (see `do_transition/3`), and only
  the status-transition call itself — `Trackers.transition/2`. That call is
  safe to repeat for every adapter: each one reads the upstream item's current
  state first and only issues a write if it isn't already there (GitHub/GitLab
  compare `state` + label; Jira walks the live workflow graph from the item's
  actual current status; Shortcut checks `completed`). A rate-limited response
  means GitHub/GitLab/Jira rejected the request before applying it, so retrying
  a request that never took effect cannot double-apply — and if a prior
  attempt's write *did* land despite our client not observing the response,
  the next attempt's read sees the target state and no-ops rather than
  re-issuing the write.

  `Trackers.update_fields/2` (the gated-field push in
  `ensure_gated_fields_pushed/2`) is a plain "set these fields to these
  values" PUT/PATCH — repeating it with the same values is a no-op, so it
  would also be safe to retry, though it currently is not (see below).

  The one non-idempotent write in this module, `add_comment/2` (posting the
  `:pr_opened` PR-link comment), is deliberately **outside** the retry loop:
  `comment_pr/2` calls it directly, not through `do_transition/3`, so a
  rate-limited comment post fails (or escalates) once rather than risking a
  duplicate comment on retry.

  Log loudly and raise an escalation for a tracker-sync failure. The
  single place a swallowed-error regression would have to get past.

  Escalations are deduplicated: at most **one** escalation is raised per
  `(task_id, event)` pair within a #{div(@failure_dedup_ttl_ms, 60_000)}-minute
  window. Subsequent calls still log at `:error` level (for visibility) but
  suppress the coordinator mailbox message, preventing escalation-spam when multiple
  callers (Watchdog, MergeQueue, MergedPRFinalizer) fire the same failure in
  quick succession on a single merge.
