defmodule Arbiter.Mergers.Direct do
  @moduledoc """
  The direct merger. Executes a local `git merge --no-ff` immediately — no
  merge request, no review gate. This is the current default strategy and the
  "personal project" path: the branch is integrated into the target the moment
  `open/4` is called.

  ## Required opt: `:repo_path`

  Unlike a hosted forge, `Direct` operates on a local checkout, so `open/4`
  needs to know which repository (the repo path) to run inside. Pass it via the
  `opts` map:

      Direct.open("feature/bd-1qx1nt", "Merge bd-1qx1nt", "", %{
        repo_path: "/path/to/repo",
        target_branch: "main"
      })

  `:target_branch` defaults to `"main"` when omitted.

  ## mr_ref format

  The opaque `mr_ref` produced by `open/4` encodes the branch, repo path, and
  target branch as a `"|"`-delimited string so that callbacks that receive only
  the ref can perform local git operations without additional opts:

      "direct:<branch>|<repo_path>|<target_branch>"

  Callers must treat the format as opaque. `branch_from_ref/1` decodes the
  branch name when needed.

  ## Callback semantics

    * `open/4` — checks out `target_branch` and runs `git merge --no-ff
      <branch>` in `repo_path`, then pushes `target_branch` to `origin`.
      Returns `{:ok, ref}` where `ref` encodes the branch, repo path, and
      target branch. The merge commit message is `title` when given, otherwise
      git's default. A checkout with no `origin` remote (a local-only repo,
      bd-73zv62) skips the push: the local merge is the whole integration.
    * `update_branch/1` — rebases the working branch forward onto its base
      (`git checkout <branch>` then `git rebase <target_branch>` inside
      `repo_path`). Returns `:ok` on success or
      `{:error, {:rebase_conflict, %{branch:, base:, files:, output:}}}` on a
      conflict (the rebase is aborted so the tree stays clean). Returns
      `{:error, :no_repo_path}` when the ref doesn't carry a repo path (e.g.
      an old-format or hand-constructed ref).
    * `get/1` — always `{:ok, %{status: :merged}}`; once `open/4` succeeds the
      branch is already integrated, so there is no other state to report.
    * `merge/2`, `close/1`, `add_comment/2`, `request_review/2` — no-ops
      returning `:ok` (there is no MR to act on).
    * `link_for/1` — returns an empty string (no web UI).

  ## Optional callbacks not implemented

  `reply_to_review_comment/4` — `Direct` has no remote forge and no concept
  of threaded review comments, so this optional callback is not exported.
  Callers guard with `function_exported?/3` before calling it.

  `list_open_review_threads/1` and `list_open/0` are also not implemented for
  the same reason: there is no MR or forge thread surface.

  ## Review callbacks

  `Direct` has no MR to comment on and no forge UI to host a review. For
  the `Arbiter.Workflows.CodeReview` adapter path it implements:

    * `get_diff/2` — runs `git diff <base>..<branch>` in `opts[:repo_path]`,
      where `<branch>` is decoded from the `mr_ref` (the canonical
      `"direct:<branch>"` form, or a bare branch name as a fallback).
      `:target_branch` in opts overrides the base; default is `"main"`.
    * `post_inline_comment/3` — appends a per-finding section to a local
      Markdown review file under `opts[:repo_path]/reviews/<branch>.md`,
      mirroring the `LocalMode` format the `:local` workflow path uses.
    * `submit_review/4` — rewrites the verdict line in the same review file.

  This keeps "direct" reviews reproducible artifacts — the review is a
  file in the repo, with the same shape `:local` mode produces — while
  letting the workflow stay adapter-shaped.

  ## Conflict handling — never leave the canonical tree broken

  `open/4` operates on the *canonical* checkout (the repo), and the live Phoenix
  server compiles from that same working tree. A conflicted `git merge` would
  otherwise leave the tree half-merged and conflict-markered — uncompilable —
  and the running server can no longer hot-reload (incident bd-1rhyla: a
  conflicted auto-merge wedged the beam and took the fleet down).

  So a failed merge is made *atomic*: `open/4` captures the conflicting paths,
  then runs `git merge --abort` to restore the clean, compilable tree before
  returning. A genuine conflict returns

      {:error, {:merge_conflict, %{branch: branch, files: [path, ...], output: raw_git_output}}}

  so the caller (the worker lifecycle) can escalate to the coordinator inbox with
  the conflicting files and park the task for rebase — without ever marking it
  merged. Any other (non-conflict) git failure still returns
  `{:error, {:git_failed, output}}`, and the abort runs defensively regardless
  (a no-op when no merge is in progress).
