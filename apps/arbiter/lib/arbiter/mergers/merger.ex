  Behaviour for merge-request / integration adapters.

  An adapter implements this for one merge backend: the local `Direct` merge
  (no MR, no review gate — the current default), or a hosted forge
  (`GitLab`, `GitHub` — wired up in later directives). The `Arbiter.Mergers`
  helper resolves which adapter to use for a given workspace by reading
  `workspace.config["merge"]["strategy"]`.

  This mirrors the `Arbiter.Trackers.Tracker` abstraction: a behaviour, a
  dispatcher that resolves the adapter from workspace config, and one module
  per backend.

  ## `mr_ref`

  Every adapter mints an opaque `t:mr_ref/0` (a binary) from `open/4` and
  accepts it back on the remaining callbacks. Callers should treat it as
  opaque — its internal shape is adapter-specific (e.g.
  `"direct:<branch>|<repo_path>|<target>"` for `Direct`, a
  project/MR-iid pair for GitLab, an owner/repo/PR-number triple for GitHub).

  ## `opts` map (passed to `open/4`)

  Task-domain keys, all optional unless an adapter says otherwise:

    * `:target_branch` — branch to integrate into (e.g. `"main"`).
    * `:reviewer_ids` — reviewers to request on open.
    * `:labels` — labels to apply to the MR.

  Individual adapters may read additional keys (the `Direct` adapter, for
  instance, requires a `:repo_path` since it operates on a local checkout).

  ## Callback semantics

    * `open/4` — open the merge request (or perform the merge, for `Direct`)
      for `branch`. Returns `{:ok, mr_ref}`.
    * `get/1` — fetch the current state of the MR as an opaque map.
    * `merge/2` — merge the MR (no-op where `open/4` already merged), guarded
      on the caller's reviewed SHA. See "The reviewed-SHA guard" below.
    * `close/1` — close the MR without merging.
    * `add_comment/2` — post a comment on the MR.
    * `request_review/2` — request review from `reviewers`.
    * `link_for/1` — return a human-clickable URL for the ref (empty string
      when the backend has no web UI, e.g. `Direct`).

  ## The reviewed-SHA guard

  `merge/2` takes the SHA the merge decision was computed against and hands it
  to the forge as an atomic precondition. `Arbiter.Mergers.ReviewedSha` owns
  how callers derive that SHA (and when they refuse outright); this behaviour
  only fixes the contract that every adapter must honour it.

  ## Review callbacks

  The remaining callbacks let `Arbiter.Workflows.CodeReview` operate on a
  PR/MR through the same adapter abstraction, instead of hard-coding a
  GitHub HTTP client. They take a small `opts` map so callers can pass
  adapter-specific context (e.g. the `Direct` adapter's `:repo_path` and
  `:target_branch`) without having to pre-seed a per-process config.

    * `get_diff/2` — fetch the unified diff text for `mr_ref`. For local
      adapters this is `git diff <base>..<branch>`; for hosted forges it is
      the diff payload returned by the API.
    * `post_inline_comment/3` — post a single finding as an inline review
      comment (or its adapter-specific equivalent, e.g. a local-file entry
      for `Direct`).
    * `submit_review/4` — submit a final review verdict (approve or
      request_changes) with a body. Adapters that have no concept of a
      "review" (e.g. `Direct`) write the verdict locally.

  Re-run CI for `mr_ref`, choosing the *granularity* of the re-run
  (bd-5mzzww / #1448).

  Arbiter had no CI-retry verb at all: every retry was a human clicking the
  forge UI, and the affordance a human reaches for first — GitHub's "re-run
  failed jobs" — reuses every job that already succeeded. When the failing
  check consumes an artifact an earlier job in the same run produced (a review
  app, a built image), that re-run re-tests the identical stale input and is
  deterministically guaranteed to fail again. Ours did, twice, 19 hours apart.

  `opts` is a map:

    * `:mode` — `:auto` (default), `:failed_jobs`, `:all_jobs` or `:workflow`.
      `:auto` delegates to `Arbiter.Mergers.CIRerun.choose/1`, which prefers a
      full rebuild whenever a failed-jobs re-run would reuse completed upstream
      jobs, or whenever one has already been tried.
    * `:workflow` — name or file basename of the workflow to re-run, when the
      head commit has more than one failed run.
    * `:inputs` — string-keyed workflow inputs (e.g. `%{"force_deploy" => "true"}`).
      Supplying any input forces `:workflow` mode, since only a fresh dispatch
      can carry them. Combining inputs with an explicit `:failed_jobs` /
      `:all_jobs` mode is a validation error rather than a silent drop — those
      endpoints replay the original run's inputs and cannot carry new ones.

  caller falls back for every ref. An empty `refs` returns `{:ok, %{}}` and makes
  no request.

  `isRequired(pullRequestNumber:)` is resolved per PR (each against that PR's own
  branch protection) — it is never hoisted across PRs.

  Optional — adapters without a batch surface (e.g. `Direct`) simply don't
  implement it; callers guard with `function_exported?/3` and fall back to the
  per-PR path for every ref.

  Is `ancestor` an ancestor of `descendant` in the repo this MR lives in?

  The ancestry *proof* `Arbiter.Reviews.Coverage`'s rule 2 needs (P4 of
  `docs/review-coverage-and-guard-policy.md`, bd-df3zlo / #1736): a head the
  forge reports that is an ancestor of the head we pushed is the forge lagging
  our own push, and the merge must wait rather than refuse. A head that is a
  *descendant* — a post-approval fix-pass commit — is not a lag, and the
  difference between the two is not visible from the shas alone.

  Both arguments are full 40-hex commit ids; a symbolic ref is rejected rather
  than resolved, because the coverage model compares shas for equality.

  Three answers, and the difference between the last two is load-bearing:

    * `{:ok, true}` — proven ancestor (a commit is its own ancestor).
    * `{:ok, false}` — proven *not* an ancestor: unrelated, or a descendant.
    * `{:error, reason}` — could not tell (API error, timeout, unknown commit).
      Never collapse this into `{:ok, false}`: the reader treats a `false` as
      permission to go on and decide the merge on content, and an error as a
      reason to pause.

  Optional — an adapter with no repo to ask (e.g. `Direct`) simply does not
  implement it, and callers guard with `function_exported?/3`. A caller that
  cannot ask supplies no probe at all, which leaves rule 2 unreachable.

  Prepare the current process to make adapter calls for `workspace`.

  Seeds the adapter's per-process config so subsequent adapter calls in this
  process see the workspace's configuration without threading the workspace

  `workspace` may be `nil`, which clears the per-process config.
  `opts` is a keyword list; recognized keys include `:repo` for per-repo overrides.
