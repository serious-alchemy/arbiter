defmodule Arbiter.Mergers.PendingMerge do
  @moduledoc """
  The durable record of an approved merge that has not happened yet
  (bd-a370ak / #2002).

  ## Problem this solves

  The merge decision for an approved PR used to live only in the memory of
  the `Arbiter.Worker.Watchdog` paired with the worker that opened it. The
  Watchdog monitors that worker and stops with it, so when the worker exited
  — its machine died, it was reaped, the server restarted — while the merge
  was waiting on something transient (CI still running, a draft PR, a 405/409
  from the forge), nothing ever looked at the PR again. Three approved, green,
  mergeable PRs sat for 17+ hours that way.

  ## The stamp

  Whenever a live Watchdog on an auto-merge lane reaches an *approved* verdict
  but does not merge on that poll, it stamps `issues.pending_merge` with:

    * `mr_ref` — the PR/MR the merge is for;
    * `reviewed_sha` — the reviewed baseline the Watchdog's stale-SHA guard was
      holding. For a ReviewGate lane that baseline otherwise exists only in the
      Watchdog's memory, and a retry without it would have no way to tell the
      approved commit apart from anything pushed afterwards;
    * `via_review_gate` — how the PR was approved (the forge never sees an
      in-process ReviewGate approval);
    * `reason` / `detail` — why the merge did not happen (`ci_pending`,
      `merge_failed`, ...), for the operator;
    * `since` — when this merge first started waiting;
    * `escalated_at` / `escalation_reason` — set once a retry has given up and
      paged the coordinator. A stamp carrying it is never retried again; the
      page is the hand-off to a human;
    * `notified_block` — a blocker the retry is *still waiting out* but has
      already told the coordinator about (red CI, `note_block/2`), so a restart
      or a re-armed retry does not tell them again. Unlike `escalated_at` it
      does not stop the retry.

  `Arbiter.Workflows.PendingMergeSweeper` re-arms a worker-less retry for any
  stamp nobody owns any more, and that retry runs the Watchdog's own merge
  guards (`Arbiter.Worker.Watchdog.start_retry/1`).

  The stamp is cleared by a merge, by a PR that closed unmerged, and by the
  task's `:close` / `:await_verification` actions.

  Every function here is best-effort: the stamp is written from the
  Watchdog's poll loop, and a DB hiccup there must never take the merge lane
  down with it.

  `attrs` takes `:mr_ref`, `:reviewed_sha`, `:via_review_gate`, `:reason` and

  the same merge (same MR, same reviewed baseline); any fresh stamp clears a
  previous escalation, because a live Watchdog stamping again means somebody
  re-dispatched the work. A task that is already `:closed` or parked at
