defmodule Arbiter.Mergers.NetDiff do
  @moduledoc """
  A stable fingerprint for a PR's **net contribution** (bd-6bg54c / #1573).

  The reviewed-SHA guard (`Arbiter.Mergers.ReviewedSha`) compares raw commit
  SHAs, so any commit that changes the head refuses the merge — including a
  merge *from the base branch*, which changes the head without changing a
  single line the PR contributes. In the captured incident that shape blocked
  arbiter #1572 outright: `git diff origin/main...<sha> | git patch-id --stable`
  produced the *same* patch-id (`e3d29b52…`) for the reviewed SHA and the head,
  so byte-identical reviewed content sat unmergeable while the Watchdog retried
  303 times.

  This module is the content-level second opinion. Given the PR's diff against
  its merge base at two different heads — what `c:Arbiter.Mergers.Merger.get_diff/2`
  returns for `%{base: base_ref, head: sha}`, which both hosted adapters
  implement as a three-dot (merge-base) compare — `equivalent?/2` answers
  "does the newer head contribute exactly what the reviewer already approved?"

  ## What the normalization removes, and why

  `fingerprint/1` is `git patch-id --stable` in spirit: hash the diff with the
  parts that move for reasons unrelated to content stripped out.

    * **Hunk header ranges** (`@@ -10,6 +10,7 @@`) — a base merge that touched an
      earlier region of the same file shifts every following hunk. The section
      heading after the closing `@@` moves with it, so it goes too.
    * **`index <old>..<new> <mode>` lines** — blob hashes of the *pre-image*
      change whenever the base moves under the PR.
    * **Trailing whitespace** on each line, and blank padding at either end.

  Everything else is retained verbatim, including `diff --git` headers (so a
  file appearing or disappearing changes the fingerprint), every `+`/`-` line,
  and every context line.

  ## How a conflict-resolving merge is detected

  It is detected by *not* being equivalent, which falls out of keeping the
  content lines. A merge from the base that resolves a conflict by writing new
  content necessarily changes the PR's own diff against the merge base — the
  resolved hunk is the PR's contribution now, and it differs from the one the
  reviewer approved. So its fingerprint differs and the head is treated as
  unreviewed, exactly like an authored commit.

  The converse — a clean base merge whose *context* lines shift because the
  base rewrote lines adjacent to the PR's hunk — also changes the fingerprint,
  and is likewise treated as unreviewed. That is deliberate: at the diff level
  a rewritten context line is indistinguishable from an authored one, and the
  guard exists to fail closed. The cost of the false negative is one extra
  review round, not a merge of unreviewed code.

  Fingerprint a PR's net contribution by asking its merger adapter for the

  exact range; with either missing it falls back to the whole-PR diff, which
  both hosted adapters already serve as `base...head`. Every failure — an

  — resolves to `nil`, the same "could not tell" value `fingerprint/1` returns
  for an empty diff. A caller that needs a real fingerprint must treat `nil` as
  a failed computation, never as evidence of equality.
