defmodule Arbiter.Mergers.Github do
  @moduledoc """
  GitHub adapter implementing `Arbiter.Mergers.Merger`.

  Wraps GitHub's REST API v3 for pull-request open / get / merge / close /
  comment / request-review flows. This is the hosted-forge merge path for
  GitHub-hosted rigs (and for Arbiter's own repo).

  ## Active-workspace contract

  The `Merger` behaviour callbacks take an opaque `mr_ref` with no workspace
  context. But GitHub needs an owner, repo, token, and default settings — all
  workspace-scoped. We resolve those through `Arbiter.Mergers.Github.Config`,
  exactly as `Arbiter.Trackers.Jira` does for the tracker side:

    1. Callers (request middleware, CLI command, scheduler job) call
       `Config.put_active(workspace)` to populate the per-process config.
    2. `Application.get_env(:arbiter, :github_merger_default_config)` is the
       fallback for tools that run without a workspace context.
    3. With neither, callbacks return `{:error, %Error{kind: :config_missing}}`.

  ## `mr_ref`

  The opaque ref minted by `open/4` is one of:

    * `"<owner>/<repo>#<number>"` — when the target repo was derived per-repo
      from the repo's git remote (multi-repo workspaces where `merge.config`
      omits `repo`). The owner/repo are baked into the ref so later
      callbacks (`get/1`, `merge/2`, …) talk to the same repo without
      re-resolving.
    * `"#<number>"` — when the target repo came from workspace config
      (`merge.config.repo`). The legacy single-repo shape; owner/repo are
      re-read from the active workspace cfg on each callback.

  Callers should treat the ref as opaque — the shape is internal.

  ## Per-repo repo derivation

  When `workspace.config["merge"]["config"]` omits `repo` (a multi-repo
  workspace whose repos live in *different* repos, e.g. the `acme`
  workspace's four `acme-corp/*` repos), `open/4` derives the
  target repo from the repo's `origin` remote via
  `Arbiter.Mergers.Github.RepoResolver` and bakes the result into the
  minted `mr_ref`. The caller passes the repo path through `opts.repo_path`
  (the same key the `Direct` adapter already requires; the worker seeds
  it from the repo's worktree).

  ## Config selection

  The `Arbiter.Mergers` dispatcher resolves this adapter when a workspace's
  `config["merge"]["strategy"]` is `"github"`. The adapter's own settings live
  under `config["merge"]["config"]` — see `Arbiter.Mergers.Github.Config`.

  ## Auth

  GitHub uses **Bearer** auth. The credentials reference lives in the merger
  config; `credentials_ref` is a small DSL — currently only `"env:NAME"` is
  supported (looks up `System.get_env/1`); a bare string is treated as a
  literal token.

  ## Tests

  Wired up to `Req.Test`: when
  `Application.get_env(:arbiter, :github_http_stub, false)` is true, every
  request injects `plug: {Req.Test, #{inspect(Arbiter.Mergers.Github.HTTP)}}`.
  This adapter **never** hits a real GitHub endpoint from tests.

  @doc """
  Whether the authenticated token's own identity currently has a *pending*
  review request on the PR — i.e. its login appears in GitHub's
  `requested_reviewers`. GitHub clears that bit automatically the moment we
  submit a review, so seeing it set again means someone (typically the PR
  author) explicitly re-requested review from us since our last one — the
  same signal a human "approval is sticky unless asked again" convention
  keys on. Used to override ReviewPatrol's sticky-approval decline
  (bd-8us1cp) even when the new commits would otherwise classify as
  doc/test/formatting-only.

  Returns `{:ok, boolean()}` or `{:error, term()}`. When the token's own
  login can't be resolved, returns `{:ok, false}` — we can't tell whether the
  request targets us, so we don't override.

  Not part of the `Merger` behaviour: an optional capability the sticky-
  approval gate probes via `function_exported?/3`, so an adapter without it
  (e.g. GitLab) fails open (no override; unchanged prior behavior).

  # more, to keep the GraphQL points cost low (bd-3byp1n: "the points budget
  # must not become the new ceiling"):
  #
  #   * `reviews` states → changes_requested (same as `list_review_feedback/1`).
  #   * `reviewThreads { isResolved }` → the unresolved-thread COUNT PRPatrol
  #     triggers on. Comments are fetched `first: 1` (the opening comment, for
  #     thread author/body context) plus a second aliased `last: 1` page (the
  #     latest comment, bd-45x4yo — `answered_by_us?/2` needs to know who spoke
  #     LAST, not who opened the thread, or a thread we already replied to and
  #     left unresolved gets miscounted as still-open every tick) — NOT
  #     `first: 100` like the single-PR `@review_threads_query`. PRPatrol
  #     doesn't need the full comment tree; that's re-read per-PR by the
  #     follow-up worker via `list_open_review_threads/1`. Dropping the 100×100
  #     comment fan-out (2 comment nodes/thread instead) is what keeps this
  #     query's node cost ~one rollup page per PR instead of ~10k nodes/PR.
