defmodule Arbiter.Skills.Skill do
  @moduledoc """
  A `Skill` is a user-authored, reusable instruction module (à la superpowers'
  `SKILL.md`) that arbiter materializes into a worker's worktree at
  `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` so a `--print` worker discovers and can
  invoke it as `/<name>` (activation confirmed by spike bd-5tc1s0).

  ## Scoping: global (default) or workspace-scoped

  A skill has an optional `workspace_id` (bd-9j6is7):

    * `nil` → **global** — the original behaviour, shared by every workspace.
    * a workspace id → **workspace-scoped** — visible only to that workspace.

  A workspace-scoped skill **shadows** a global skill of the same name *for
  that workspace only*. Precedence (see `Arbiter.Skills.resolve_skill/2`):

      workspace-scoped `name` in ws  →  global `name`  →  not found

  So tuning `tdd` for `acme` (a scoped row) never touches the `default`
  workspace, which keeps resolving the global `tdd`. Global uniqueness is
  preserved (two globals named `tdd` collide); a scoped skill may reuse a
  global's name, and two workspaces may each hold their own `tdd`. This is
  enforced by the `[:name, :workspace_id]` identity with `nils_distinct?:
  false` (so the two `nil`-workspace globals collide, but a global and a
  scoped row do not).

  The layered selection of *which* skills apply to a given worker (workspace /
  repo / task) is resolved at dispatch time (epic child 3), and now resolves
  each name through `resolve_skill/2` so a scoped body shadows the global.

  ## Version history + actor (paper_trail)

  Every create/update is captured as an `AshPaperTrail` version
  (`Arbiter.Skills.Skill.Version`), so a `skill_update` that overwrites `body`
  is recoverable (`Arbiter.Skills.skill_versions/1` +
  `restore_skill_version/3`). Each version snapshots the `actor` that made it —
  a stable string label (`Arbiter.PaperTrail.actor_label/1`) threaded through
  the Ash `actor:` option — so a change is attributable, not just diffable.

  ## Fields

    * `:name` — unique, kebab-case identifier. Doubles as the slash command
      (`/<name>`) and the materialized directory name. Debug output scopes
      names as `{source}:{name}` (e.g. `project:tdd`); the invocable command is
      the unscoped `/tdd`.
    * `:body` — the markdown skill body (the `SKILL.md` contents).
    * `:metadata` — optional free-form map (e.g. `description`, `tags`).

  ## `managed_by` vs `actor` (bd-blxwla)

  `managed_by` (`:operator | :loop | :unknown`) records **who authored** the
  skill — a human/coordinator-driven write vs one `Arbiter.Loop.Apply` made on
  the loop's behalf. `actor` is a different axis entirely: a free-form label
  of *who made the most recent write* (for paper-trail attribution), not who
  the skill is *for* or who originated it. A loop-authored skill can still be
  edited by an operator afterwards — `actor` moves, `managed_by` does not (it
  is fixed at creation, like `workspace_id`).

  This distinction has to exist **before** the first loop-authored skill
  lands (#1011 comment 5224098209 §5): once the loop has written a skill body
  without this flag, there is no way to reconstruct after the fact which
  registry rows are machine-authored — the split becomes unrecoverable
  paper-trail archaeology. Every skill in the registry as of this attribute's
  introduction predates loop payload-authoring, so all of them backfill to
  `:operator`; `:unknown` exists for provenance that genuinely can't be
  established and should have zero rows in practice.

  ## Name collisions with bundled skills

  Every `--print` worker always sees ~20 built-in "bundled" skills
  (`code-review`, `deep-research`, …) regardless of what arbiter materializes
  (spike finding #3). A registry skill whose name collides with a bundled one
  is still allowed — the project-source skill wins for its `/<name>` command —
  but authors are *warned* at author time. The warning is surfaced by the
  callers (`Arbiter.Skills.bundled_collision/1`), not enforced as a DB
  constraint, so an operator can deliberately shadow a bundled skill.
