  Record the dispatch context of the calling worker on its own registry entry:
  the workspace it is running for and the provider it was dispatched with.

  Called by `Arbiter.Worker.init/1`. The registry value — not a counter
  anywhere — is what makes `Arbiter.Accounts.Concurrency.live_count/1`
  authoritative (`docs/provider-account-design.md` §4.2): it exists exactly as
  long as the process does, so a crashed or killed worker releases its slot
  with no decrement call on any path.

  Must be called *from* the registered process; `Registry.update_value/3` only
  lets an owner rewrite its own value. A non-owner (or an unregistered key) is
  a no-op rather than an error — the dispatch context is an optimisation for
