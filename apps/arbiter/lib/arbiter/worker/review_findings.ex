defmodule Arbiter.Worker.ReviewFindings do
  @moduledoc """
  Finding identity and the per-round DISPOSITIONS protocol (bd-6r8caj / #1137).

  ## The hole this closes

  `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate` could return `VERDICT: APPROVE` /
  `VERIFICATION: FULL` on a revision round that never revisited the finding it
  itself raised in the previous round. Observed on `bd-8mtb0q` (#1132): round 1
  raised a Medium finding citing `failure_classifier.ex:172-185`, the implementer
  round produced an *empty* diff for that file (it only ran `mix format`), and
  round 2 approved with zero findings in 94.7s. Nothing in the gate could tell,
  because `review_gate_rounds.findings` is free prose — a finding had no identity
  that survived the round boundary, so "was finding X addressed?" was not a
  question the gate could ask, let alone answer.

  That failure mode is worse than the two already-known ones (a revising round
  that times out, a round with no parseable verdict): those fail loudly. This one
  succeeds loudly and wrongly, manufacturing unearned confidence — and with no CI
  on pull requests, ReviewGate is the only automated gate between a diff and
  `main`.

  ## What this module provides

    * **Identity** — `extract/2` turns a REQUEST_CHANGES round's prose findings
      into `%{id: "F<round>.<n>", severity:, files:, text:}` items. Ids are
      round-namespaced so round 2's findings can never collide with round 1's.
    * **Severity ranking** — `blocking?/1` is true for Medium-or-higher. A
      finding whose text carries no recognizable severity label ranks `:unknown`
      and is treated as blocking: this is a correctness gate, so an unlabelled
      finding fails closed rather than slipping through.
    * **Disposition parsing** — `dispositions/1` reads the `DISPOSITIONS:` block
      a round-N+1 reviewer must emit: one `[ADDRESSED]` / `[NOT ADDRESSED]` /
      `[OBSOLETE]` line per carried-forward finding id.
    * **The approval gap** — `approval_gap/3` is what makes `VERIFICATION: FULL`
      checkable. It returns the blocking findings that the approving round left
      `missing` (no disposition at all), `unaddressed` (explicitly
      `[NOT ADDRESSED]`), or `unproven` (claimed `[ADDRESSED]` while the
      implementer's diff never touched a cited file and the disposition names no
      alternative location — the mechanical backstop that would have caught
      bd-8mtb0q on its own).
    * **Prompt + persistence surfaces** — the blocks the re-review prompt renders,
      and the JSON encodings persisted onto `review_gate_rounds`.

  `[OBSOLETE]` is a first-class disposition on purpose: a finding invalidated by
  a different fix must be dispositionable, or the guard would dead-end
  legitimately stale findings.

  # survive the match — bd-bm6bfs: without it, `.gitlab-ci.yml` was captured as
