defmodule Arbiter.Worker.Watchdog do
  @moduledoc """
  Watchdog process for a worker parked at `:awaiting_review`.

  When an worker finishes its work it opens a merge request and the paired
  `Arbiter.Worker` transitions `:running -> :awaiting_review`, spawning one
  Watchdog. The Watchdog polls `Arbiter.Mergers.get/1` on an interval and drives
  the worker to its terminal state based on the MR's fate:

      MR merged           -> Worker.complete(:merged)
      MR approved         -> (auto_merge) Mergers.merge/2 (guarded on the reviewed SHA) then complete(:merged)
                          -> (manual)     stay parked; a human merges, next
                                          poll sees :merged, then complete
      MR closed/rejected  -> Worker.fail({:mr_closed, ref})

  One Watchdog supervises one worker. It is started under
  `Arbiter.Worker.WatchdogSupervisor` (a `DynamicSupervisor`, `restart:
  :temporary`) and monitors the worker: if the worker dies, the Watchdog
  stops.

  ## The reviewed-SHA guard (bd-dxgris / #1493)

  Auto-merge acts on a review verdict computed against one specific commit. If
  the branch advances between that verdict and the merge, merging "current
  head" merges commits no reviewer ever saw — and this retry loop is where the
  window is widest (both captured production incidents, `vs-cgh54b`/!177 and
  `vs-a7w5g9`/!179, sat in it for many polls).

  So the Watchdog carries a baseline: the task's recorded `last_reviewed_sha`
  when it has one, otherwise the head observed on the first poll whose
  *effective* outcome was `:approved` (which, on a `via_review_gate` lane, is
  the commit the in-process gate approved). `safe_merge/1` refuses when the
  current head has moved past it, and otherwise hands it to `merge/2` as the
  forge's own atomic precondition. A refusal is a normal merge failure: the
  lane stays parked and the coordinator is paged.

  The latch is deliberately *suspended* when the fleet advances the branch with
  an update-branch — a base merge, which carries no content of its own — see
  `clear_reviewed_latch/1`. That push lands asynchronously, several polls
  after it is issued, so the suspension has to survive until the head actually
  moves rather than being a one-shot nil the next poll re-latches.

  A CI fix pass or a conflict resolution is different: it AUTHORS content after
  the approval, so since P7 (bd-60r6wp / #1738, design §4.5) it keeps the
  approved baseline pinned instead (`note_authored_push/1`). Its head is then
  judged on content: an unchanged net diff merges on a `:mechanical` coverage
  row, anything else goes back to a review round the ReviewGate scopes to the
  delta since the covered commit. Before P7 the suspension re-latched onto the
  fix-pass head, which is how #1702, #1723 and #1725 merged commits no review
  had seen.
  `Arbiter.Mergers.ReviewedSha` records the rest of the reasoning, including
  why "no baseline" merges unguarded rather than refusing.

  And the guard will not call a head unreviewed until it has evidence the
  forge's view of the branch is current (bd-ch9pmk / #1614). "Current" means
  the PR has, at least once, reported the `:local_head_sha` this worker pushed
  to origin moments before the Watchdog started. A hosted forge's PR resource
  is eventually consistent with the ref it tracks, so the very first poll of an
  approved fix round routinely reads the *pre*-fix-round head — which is not a
  branch that advanced past the review, it is a review the forge has not caught
  up with yet. Waiting for that echo (bounded by `@head_lag_grace_polls`) is
  what keeps a REQUEST_CHANGES -> fix -> APPROVE cycle from failing the worker
  and buying a full re-review of code that was just approved.

  ## Approval detection lives in one function

  `classify/1` maps a `Mergers.get/1` result map to one of `:merged |
  :approved | :closed | :pending`. It is the *single* decision surface — the
  poll loop and any future push trigger both route through it.

  ## Auto-resolving blocked merges (#354, Phase 2a)

  An *approved* PR that still can't merge carries a `block_reason`
  (`effective_block_reason/1`). On an `auto_merge` lane the Watchdog tries to
  resolve the two mechanically-fixable reasons itself before escalating:

      :behind_base -> `adapter.update_branch/1` (update-branch), then re-poll.
                      A failed update (conflict introduced) falls through to
                      `:conflict` handling.
      :ci_failed   -> dispatch a fix-pass worker (briefed with the failing
                      check logs via `adapter.failing_check_logs/1`) to fix the
                      root cause and push, then re-poll.

  Each attempt increments a per-episode counter; after `max_auto_resolve_attempts`
  (default 2) the Watchdog stops retrying and escalates with the reason + attempt
  count, and lifts its poll ceiling (`max_polls`) to `:infinity` so it parks and
  keeps watching indefinitely instead of dying at the finite auto_merge ceiling —
  an out-of-band fix (e.g. a manual pipeline retry) that later makes the MR
  mergeable is picked back up on a later poll rather than being missed because
  the only process watching the MR already exited (bd-krg7ci). The lifted
  ceiling is restored once the block clears (`poll_count` resets with it), and
  the exhausted-retry escalation itself re-fires periodically (every
  `base_max_polls` polls) while parked, so a block that never resolves keeps
  paging the coordinator instead of going silent after the first page. The
  remaining reasons (`:conflict`, `:needs_approval`, `:draft`, `:blocked_other`)
  keep the Phase 1 behaviour: escalate once and park.

  The per-episode counter alone does not bound `:ci_failed`: a fix pass's push
  ends the episode (the new head's CI is pending), so a flake recurring on each
  head restarts it at 1. A separate per-task cap, `max_fix_passes` (default 3),
  counts every fix pass on the PR across heads and across Watchdogs (from the
  persisted `worker_runs`), and parks through the same exhausted path once hit
  (bd-2l0hzm).

  A `:ci_failed` block whose failing tests are all outside the PR's diff (read
  from the failing checks' files and the PR diff, see
  `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.FlakeSuspect`) is re-run once per head instead
  of getting a fix pass. If the re-run fails again in a test that failed before,
  the failure reproduces and a fix pass is dispatched, briefed not to edit those
  tests. If only *different* untouched tests fail, the block is escalated as a
  suspected flake (`:ci_failed_external`, with the tests in the note) and no fix
  pass runs.

  ## Clearing an indefinite `:ci_failed` park (bd-5mzzww)

  A parked `:ci_failed` block used to have exactly one exit: push a code fix.
  That is the wrong exit when the failing check tests an artifact an *earlier
  job in the same CI run* produced — a per-branch review app, a built image —
  because nothing in the diff is broken and the forge's own "re-run failed
  jobs" affordance REUSES that stale artifact, so it fails identically every
  time. One PR sat parked for 19 hours on exactly this shape. Three additions:

    * `rerun_ci/2` delegates to the adapter's optional `rerun_ci/2` and chooses
      the *granularity* (`Arbiter.Mergers.CIRerun`): `:failed_jobs` reuses
      upstream output, `:all_jobs` rebuilds it, `:workflow` fires a fresh
      dispatch that can carry inputs. `:auto` escalates past `:failed_jobs`
      whenever completed upstream jobs would be reused, or the run is already
      on attempt 2+ — repeating an identical re-run tells nobody anything.
    * `mark_ci_external/2` records an "infrastructure, not this diff" verdict,
      promoting the park to `:ci_failed_external` so the coordinator escalation
      reads as broken CI rather than broken code and carries the diagnosing
      worker's note. Scoped to the current block episode: it clears as soon as
      the block reason changes, so a later genuine failure is never mislabelled.
    * `:park_heartbeat_polls` re-pings the coordinator on a park that has gone
      that many polls with no state change at all (default 720 ≈ 12h at the
      default interval; 0 disables; workspace override
      `config["merge"]["park_heartbeat_polls"]`). This is deliberately in
      tension with the once-per-episode escalation dedupe (#1226): dedupe is
      right for a block that is being worked, and wrong for one that has been
      silently abandoned.

  ## Non-author-approval block (bd-c3lchp)

  A fleet-authored PR that is fully green but parked on a required *non-author*
  approval (the forge's branch protection requires a reviewer other than the
  author — which the fleet can never be, having authored the PR) is a special
  case the adapters report as `:needs_nonauthor_approval`. The auto_merge poll
  ceiling used to mark such a PR FAILED even though nothing was broken. The
  Watchdog now parks it: it escalates to a human reviewer **once** and lifts its poll
  ceiling to `:infinity`, handing off to indefinite watching so a later human
  approval auto-merges. No failed worker, on any forge.

  ## Auto-resuming an awaiting_review timeout (bd-8eheb6)

  Hitting `max_polls` on an `auto_merge` lane fails the worker with
  `{:awaiting_review_timeout, N}` — exit_status 0, worktree preserved, MR
  usually still mergeable. That is a *cleanly resumable* run, not a crash, and
  the coordinator's remedy has always been a plain `worker_resume`. So the
  Watchdog now does it itself: `handle_review_timeout/2` still registers the
  failure reason (the timeout is real and must stay visible), then calls
  `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.AutoResumeDispatcher` — swappable via the
  `:auto_resume_dispatcher` opt — instead of leaving a "failed but resumable"
  worker for a human to spot on the dashboard.

  The budget is bounded by `:max_auto_resumes` (default 3; workspace key
  `merge.max_awaiting_review_resumes`; `0` disables it and restores the old
  escalate-and-park behaviour). The attempt counter lives on the *worker's*
  `meta[:awaiting_review_resume_attempts]`, not in Watchdog state, because each
  auto-resume mints a brand-new worker *and* a brand-new Watchdog — a
  per-Watchdog counter would reset every round and the cap would never bind.
  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch` re-stamps it onto each resumed run.

  Once the budget is spent the coordinator gets an addressed escalation reading
  "auto-resume exhausted after N attempts", deliberately distinct from a
  first-time genuine failure. Non-timeout failures (`:mr_closed`, a real crash)
  are untouched — they escalate immediately, exactly as before.

  ### When the resume is refused by the task's own subordinate pass (bd-di4t6d)

  The bd-8eheb6 path above had a single-shot failure mode that stalled tasks
  indefinitely. `Worker.start/1` allows only one live worker per task, and a
  subordinate pass (`<task>:fixpass`, `<task>:conflict`) registers under its own
  key but shares the task id — so while a fix pass dispatched by *this same
  Watchdog* is still running, `AutoResumeDispatcher.resume/1` comes back
  `{:error, {:worker_start_failed, {:task_worker_live, %{registry_key:
  "<task>:fixpass", ...}}}}`.

  That is exactly the situation the poll ceiling produces: the Watchdog
  dispatches a fix pass to clear a `:ci_failed` block, keeps polling, hits
  `max_polls` minutes later while the fix pass is still working, and fires its
  one and only auto-resume into a slot that cannot accept it. The old code
  treated that like `:no_outpost` — escalate and `{:stop, :normal, _}` — leaving
  a task in `awaiting_review` with a completed run, no live reviewer, and no
  process left that would ever look at it again. The three observed stalls
  (vs-ehjarz/!183, vs-ciouz8/!189, vs-a5miga/!198) are all this.

  A resume that never *started* is not a resume, so it must not burn the
  `:max_auto_resumes` budget. Instead the Watchdog defers: it stays alive and
  retries the resume every `interval_ms` for up to `:max_resume_deferrals`
  (default 30 ≈ 30 min at the default interval; workspace key
  `merge.max_awaiting_review_resume_deferrals`; `0` restores the pre-bd-di4t6d
  single-shot behaviour). When the blocking pass finishes, the deferred resume
  takes — a fresh main worker re-enters `route_completion` and therefore
  `enter_review_gate`, so the reviewer is re-dispatched, including for the
  `fix_pass` that caused the block.

  The deferral bound escalates once and stops, mirroring the auto-resume budget:
  `{:resume_blocked, reason, deferrals}` names the blocking registry key and
  tells the coordinator to look at the wedged subordinate pass rather than
  resume again. Only *transient* refusals defer — `:no_outpost` and friends
  still page on the first failure, unchanged.

  ### Making the deferral actually survive (bd-985tkl)

  bd-di4t6d's retry loop was unreachable in the exact case it was written for.
  `Dispatch.resume/2` calls `stop_prior_worker/1` **before** `Worker.start/1`'s
  family check refuses, so the primary worker this Watchdog monitors exits as a
  direct consequence of the resume attempt that was just deferred — and the
  `:DOWN` clause below then stopped the Watchdog, taking the
  `:retry_review_resume` timer with it. bd-3qkbch/#1724 and bd-bsdeb2/#1732 both
  logged `deferral=1/30` and then nothing at all for 70+ minutes, on approved,
  CI-green, `MERGEABLE CLEAN` PRs a coordinator had to resume by hand.

  Three things make the episode self-contained:

    * **It outlives its own worker.** While `resume_deferred` is set, the failed
      primary's `:DOWN` no longer stops the Watchdog. There is nothing left to
      watch *but* the registry slot, and the worker is already `:failed`.
    * **It re-fires on the blocker, not just the clock.** The pid named by the
      refusal is monitored, so a pass that exits (crashes, or is reaped by
      `Worker.start_or_reap_terminal/1`) re-attempts the resume immediately.
      The interval tick stays as the backstop, because a pass that finishes
      *normally* lingers in a terminal status without exiting (bd-8lq2g7). A
      monotonic token on the tick keeps the two paths from ever running two
      retry chains at once.
    * **A forge hiccup is inert.** Once deferred, this Watchdog is no longer a
      merge poller, so stray `:poll` messages are dropped rather than landing
      back on the poll ceiling — which would re-fail the worker, re-defer, and
      leave a second retry chain draining the budget at 2x. The incident logged
      `Github.Error kind: :network "socket closed"` 22 times in three hours.

  Both terminal arms — the deferral budget running out, and a blocker that is
  already dead two refusals running (`{:resume_blocker_vanished, _, _}`; nothing
  can ever signal its completion) — **park** the task with
  `review_park_reason: resume_blocked` and page the coordinator exactly once,
  the park row being the claim. That is guard class E's terminal in
  `docs/review-coverage-and-guard-policy.md` §5.3: fail open, one escalation,
  parked and still watched. The run is not re-failed and nothing is merged.

  A refusal that names the task's *own* primary key rather than a subordinate
  one is a third outcome: something already re-dispatched this task (a coordinator's
  manual `worker_resume`/`worker_review`, the reconciler, a racing dispatch), so
  the recovery being retried for has already happened. That stops the Watchdog
  quietly — deferring would page a false `{:resume_blocked, _}` against a
  healthy task and, if the blocker cleared inside the bound, fire a redundant
  resume onto work that was already finished.

  ### Webhook upgrade (design only — not implemented here)

  Polling is the shipped mechanism. A future push path would add
  `POST /webhooks/gitlab` and `POST /webhooks/github` controllers that, on a
  merge-request event, look up the Watchdog for the affected `mr_ref` and send
  it `{:mr_event, get_result}`. Because `classify/1` already encapsulates the
  approval logic, the webhook handler reuses it verbatim and the poll interval
  becomes a slow safety-net backstop rather than the primary trigger. No state
  machine changes are required to make that swap — only a new inbound message
  that calls the same `apply_outcome/2` path the poll uses.

  ## Adapter config

  Hosted-forge adapters (GitLab) resolve host/project/token from the process
  dictionary. The Watchdog runs in its own process, so it seeds that config via
  `Arbiter.Mergers.prepare_with_repo/2` in `init/1` (a no-op for `Direct`). The
  optional `:repo` opt lets a multi-GitLab-project workspace (see
  `Arbiter.Mergers.Gitlab.Config` moduledoc) resolve the project the watched
  MR actually lives in, instead of the workspace-wide default.

  Start a Watchdog under `Arbiter.Worker.WatchdogSupervisor`.

  Required opts: `:task_id`, `:worker` (pid or task_id), `:mr_ref`,
  `:adapter`. Optional:

    * `:workspace`
    * `:auto_merge` (default `false`)
    * `:via_review_gate` (default `false`) — when true, the ReviewGate gate has
      already approved this MR; the Watchdog treats every non-terminal poll as
      `:approved` and forces auto-merge, so the merge fires on the first poll
      without waiting for a hosted-forge approval the gate never posts.
    * `:interval_ms` (default `#{@default_interval_ms}`)
    * `:local_head_sha` — the branch head this worker holds locally (the commit
      it just pushed to origin). Lets the reviewed-SHA guard tell a forge that
      has not yet caught up with our own push apart from a branch that really
      advanced past the review. Optional; the guard binds as before without it.
    * `:initial_delay_ms` (default `0` — poll once promptly, then on the interval)
    * `:max_polls` — consecutive `:pending` polls before the Watchdog escalates.
      Default is `#{@default_max_polls_auto}` when `auto_merge: true` (fail
      loudly — auto-merge should fire quickly) and `:infinity` when
      `auto_merge: false` (human-merge lanes; a human may take overnight or
      longer, so the Watchdog parks rather than hard-fails). When a finite cap is
      reached on a manual lane the worker is **left parked** in
      `:awaiting_review` and the Watchdog stops polling — it is NOT failed.
      Pass `:infinity` to disable the watchdog entirely.

  Start a **worker-less merge retry** for an approved PR whose owning worker
  (and so its Watchdog) is gone (bd-a370ak / #2002). Started by
  `Arbiter.Workflows.PendingMergeSweeper` from the task's durable
  `Arbiter.Mergers.PendingMerge` stamp.

  Required opts: `:task_id`, `:mr_ref`, `:adapter`, `:reviewed_sha` (the

  It re-reads the task before every poll and again before the merge call, and
  stops without merging once the task no longer owes this merge: closed or
  finalized, reopened, its stamp cleared, re-pointed at another PR, or
  escalated.

  It polls the PR and runs the very merge decision a live Watchdog runs —
  the reviewed-SHA guard, the coverage decision, the base-merge-only
  exemption, the zero-net-diff guard — but it never dispatches a worker, and
  every outcome other than "wait" is terminal: merged (the task is finalized
  the way the Driver would), closed (the stamp is dropped), or refused
  (the coordinator is paged once and the stamp is latched escalated). See
  "Worker-less merge retry" in the moduledoc.

  Registered under `merge_retry:<task_id>` — deliberately *outside* the
  task's `<task_id>:`/`<task_id>#` registry family, so `:close`'s

  The merge-block reason to *act on* — the adapter's `block_reason/1`, but only

  The Watchdog polls throughout the ordinary pre-approval review window, and a
  not-yet-approved PR routinely classifies as "blocked": GitHub reports
  `mergeable_state == "blocked"` for an open PR merely awaiting its required
  review, and GitLab reports `not_approved` / in-progress merge statuses. Those
  are the *normal* review state, not a merge failure — the directive's silent-park
  problem is specifically an **approved** PR that still cannot merge (#354).

  So escalation and the dashboard both route through this gate, not raw
  `block_reason/1`: only an approved-but-unmergeable PR is treated as blocked.
  This also keeps the escalation debounce honest — a reason can never latch
  during the pre-approval window and suppress a later, genuine post-approval
  re-block, because the gate returns `nil` until approval lands.

  The arity-1 form is the state-less surface (the dashboard / LiveViews): it can
  only read what the forge itself reports. The poll loop uses
  `effective_block_reason/2`, which additionally knows whether the ReviewGate

  PR/MR review state. When the ReviewGate approved in-process, hosted-forge
  adapters never see that approval on the PR itself, so `classify/1` returns

  own — by design, so a structurally-broken PR can't burn cost forever. This
  is the supported external trigger for a human to say "try once more": it
  bumps this episode's budget by exactly one attempt. The already-pending
  poll timer picks this up within `interval_ms` (no immediate poll is fired
  — see the comment in the `:retry_auto_resolve` handle_call clause), which
  re-invokes the ordinary `resolve_ci_failed/2` path (dispatching a fresh
  fix-pass worker) if the block is still `:ci_failed`, or picks up whatever
  the MR's current state actually is otherwise.

  No cap on how many times a human calls this — they're presumably watching
  and will notice non-convergence — but it is never called automatically; the
  Watchdog itself only ever re-arms via this explicit external call.

  It lifts the per-task fix-pass cap (`max_fix_passes`, bd-2l0hzm) by one as
  well, so the re-armed attempt can dispatch a task that parked on that cap.

  Only bumps the budget for *this* block episode: the configured ceiling
  (`base_max_auto_resolve_attempts`) is restored once the episode clears, so
  a later, unrelated block on the same lane doesn't inherit the bump.

  # ---- worker-less merge retry (bd-a370ak / #2002) ------------------------
  #
  # A narrower loop than the live one, over the SAME guard code. It never
  # dispatches anything (no fix pass, no conflict resolver, no update-branch,
  # no auto-resume): nobody is attached to the PR any more, so anything that
  # needs a new commit or a new review round is a human's call. What it does:
  #
  #   * waits out the transient blockers — a draft PR, CI running / queued,
  #     CI red (a re-run or a new pipeline can clear it; see
  #     `detached_ci_red/1`), a not-yet-created check suite (bounded by
  #     `@not_started_grace_polls`, as live), undecided coverage;
  #   * merges through `guarded_merge_decision/1` + the zero-net-diff guard —
  #     the stale-reviewed-SHA guard, the coverage decision, the
  #     base-merge-only exemption, exactly as a live Watchdog would;
  #   * retries transient forge refusals (405/409/5xx/network), bounded;
  #   * on anything else — a stale head, an empty diff, a conflict, a
  #     non-transient refusal that keeps failing, a wait past `max_wait_ms` —
  #     pages the coordinator ONCE
  #     and latches the stamp escalated, so no later sweep or boot re-arms it.
  #
  # The baseline is the stamp's `reviewed_sha`, seeded into `reviewed_sha` at
  # init. `track_reviewed_baseline/2` is deliberately NOT run here: on a
  # nil baseline it would latch onto whatever head the first poll reports,
  # which for a retry started hours later is exactly the unreviewed commit the
  # guard exists to refuse.

  # The status poll is unattended periodic polling — the limiter's
  # `:background` class (bd-8y1i58) — and a paused read is just another

  # is genuinely ambiguous: it's the same response GitHub gives for "no CI
  # configured on this repo/commit at all" as for "check-suite not created
  # yet". Putting `:not_started` in this set would make it identical to
  # `:running`/`:pending` — deferred *forever*, since nothing ever moves a
  # no-CI repo's pipeline out of `:not_started`. Instead `apply_outcome/3`
  # handles `:not_started` itself, ahead of this check, deferring for only

  #                       both, then re-polls.
  #
  # Gated on approval (`effective_block_reason/1`): only an *approved* PR that
  # cannot merge escalates, so the ordinary pre-approval review window never
  # fires a spurious "merge blocked" alert.
  #
  # Debounced on `last_block_reason`: a given reason escalates once when it first
  # appears (or changes), not on every poll. A cleared block (reason `nil`, e.g.
  # the branch caught up, the MR merged, or approval has not landed yet) resets
  # the latch so a later re-block re-escalates. Best-effort — a notifier failure
  # must not disrupt the poll loop.
  # Phase 2b owns `:conflict`: when auto-resolve is enabled the Watchdog rebases
  # rather than paging on a conflict, and only escalates after the bounded
  # retries are exhausted (see `maybe_auto_resolve_conflict/2`). So skip the
  # generic page here for `:conflict` — the other reasons still escalate.
  # A fleet-authored PR blocked only on a required *non-author* approval can
  # never auto-merge on its own: the fleet authored it, and the forge's branch
  # protection / approval rules require a *different* reviewer the fleet can't
  # supply (it cannot approve its own PR). The 30-poll auto_merge ceiling used to
  # mark this FAILED (`{:awaiting_review_timeout, 30}`) even on a fully-green PR
  # (bd-c3lchp / lt-4kjaoe). Park it instead: summon a human reviewer once and
  # hand off to indefinite watching, so a later human approval auto-merges.
  #
  # This applies to both non-gate PRs (awaiting any reviewer) and ReviewGate PRs
  # (gate approved in-process but the forge's branch protection still requires a
  # non-author forge-level review). The coordinator reviewer submits that forge
  # approval, then signals MergeQueue (bd-bs3z04); once the forge reflects it,
  # the next poll sees :approved and auto-merges. Without this guard a
  # via_review_gate Watchdog would exhaust 30 polls trying safe_merge against a
  # forge-blocked PR and then fail the worker. (bd-bs3z04)
  #
  # Read from the *raw* block_reason rather than `effective_block_reason/1`: this
  # block is meaningful *before* approval (it is precisely *why* no approval has
  # landed), whereas the approval gate deliberately suppresses pre-approval
  # blocks. The adapters (`Github` / `Gitlab`) only emit this reason for the
  # narrow case — green, no changes requested, blocked solely on a required
  # review the author can't satisfy — so an ordinary "awaiting first review" PR

        #     even though the PR is still unapproved, which used to restore the
        #     finite ceiling and let the ordinary auto_merge timeout fail the
        #     worker out from under a PR still awaiting the same human.

        # *bounded* block (e.g. `:behind_base`/`:ci_failed` resolving within
        # `max_auto_resolve_attempts`, which never sets `park_reason`) still
        # never trips this branch, so the finite ceiling stays monotonic for
        # those flapping episodes too (bd-krg7ci round 2).

        # Deliberately raw `classify/1` here, not the ReviewGate-aware
        # `effective_block_reason/2` / `effective_outcome/2` (bd-23y19q): on a
        # gate lane the effective outcome is *always* `:approved`, which would
        # collapse this condition to "no raw block reason right now" — precisely
        # the signal lapse round 4 closed (GitLab maps an in-flight pipeline's
        # reason to `nil`). Keeping it raw means a gate lane simply never
        # revokes a park, which is the safe direction: the worker keeps watching
        # and merges the moment the block genuinely clears.
        #
        # This still excludes the separate auto-merge-failure stall park
        # (`do_apply_approved_auto_merge/1`), which lifts `max_polls` to
        # `:infinity` without ever touching `park_reason` — `park_reason` stays
        # `nil` there, so this branch doesn't fire and that lift remains
        # unconditional for the rest of the episode.
        #
        # `poll_count` resets alongside the restored cap because it's monotonic

        #
        # Also clear the merge-stall latches (`merge_stall_notified`,

  # bd-dxgris / #1493. Two layers, because one is not enough:
  #
  #   1. A LOCAL refusal, using the head this Watchdog observed on the poll it
  #      is merging on. This is what catches the incident shape — a branch that
  #      advanced several polls ago, under an approval the forge still reports
  #      as valid — and it refuses without spending a forge call, with a reason
  #      the stall page can actually name.
  #   2. The forge's own ATOMIC guard, by handing `expected_sha` to
  #      `merge/2`. Layer 1 compares against a head read one poll ago; a push
  #      landing in between would still slip past it. The forge comparing at
  #      merge time is the only thing that closes that residual window.
  #
  # A refusal returns like any other merge failure, so it flows into
  # `do_apply_approved_auto_merge/1`'s existing retry-and-page path: the lane
  # stays parked and the coordinator is paged, rather than the worker merging
  # commits nobody reviewed or dying silently.
  #
  # bd-df3zlo / #1736 (P4): which predicate produces that refusal is now a
  # workspace switch. With `merge.coverage_enabled` off — the default — this is

  # and `Arbiter.Reviews.Coverage.decide/3` shadows it. With the flag on the two

  # bd-ch9pmk / #1614. Is the head this poll reported provably older than what

  #
  # The captured incidents (bd-4fbpto / arbiter #1607, vs-bdrbp0 / vstim !219)
  # both failed an APPROVED fix round because the guard ran within seconds of
  # the push that carried the fix-round commits:
  #
  #     21:58:11  ReviewGate: stamped reviewed SHA 8e7a69ea on task=bd-4fbpto
  #     21:58:11  Worker: pushing worktree branch to origin
  #     21:58:16  Watchdog: reviewed=8e7a69ea head=ad20a410 -> {:unreviewed_head, _}
  #
  # The stamp was correct and the reviewer really had reviewed 8e7a69ea; the
  # PR resource simply still reported the pre-push head. Comparing for equality
  # cannot tell "the branch advanced past the review" from "the forge has not
  # noticed the review's own commits yet", and the second one is the common
  # path — every REQUEST_CHANGES -> fix -> APPROVE cycle ends with a push
  # milliseconds before the Watchdog's first poll.
  #
  # So the Watchdog makes NO merge decision at all until the forge has, at
  # least once, echoed back the SHA we pushed — it neither merges nor refuses.
  # Refusing was the reported bug; merging is the worse half of the same
  # confusion, because with no recorded stamp to fall back on the guard latches
  # its baseline to the first approved poll's head and would happily merge the
  # PRE-fix-round commit, dropping the fix the reviewer asked for.
  #
  # The latch lifts permanently on the first poll that confirms our head
  # (`note_local_head_visible/2`), which is why a commit landing AFTER the
  # approval — a CI `fix_pass`, a human push — still trips the guard
  # immediately: by then the forge has long since shown us our own head.

  # is a no-op once such a push is pending: an update-branch landing on top of
  # an unreviewed fix-pass commit must not re-latch onto the merge carrying it.
  #
  # This is a SUSPENSION, not a one-shot clear. The fleet's pushes land
  # asynchronously — a fix pass or a resolver run takes many polls — so simply
  # nil-ing `reviewed_sha` here is undone by `track_reviewed_baseline/2` on the
  # very next poll, which re-pins the latch to the still-unchanged pre-push
  # head; when the commit finally lands the guard then refuses it forever. So
  # we record the head the branch sat at, and hold the latch off until the head
  # moves off it — the first observable proof that the fleet's commit landed —
  # at which point the latch re-pins to the NEW head and the guard binds again.

  # P7 (bd-60r6wp / #1738, §4.5). The fleet is about to AUTHOR content on an
  # approved branch — a CI fix pass, or a conflict resolution. Unlike an
  # update-branch this push is not content-preserving by construction, so the
  # approved baseline stays exactly where it is: when the new head lands, the
  # ordinary stale-head route judges it on content. A net diff equal to the
  # approved one merges on a `:mechanical` coverage row
  # (`resolve_against_live_head/3`); anything else goes back to review, scoped
  # by the ReviewGate to the delta since the covered commit
  # (`resolve_stale_reviewed_head/3`). Nothing on this path records the new
  # head as reviewed, which is what the old suspension did.
  #
  # The deadlock the suspension existed to prevent cannot recur: the stale-head
  # route is terminal for this Watchdog (merge, or hand off to a review round),
  # never a retry against the pinned baseline.
  #
  # If an update-branch suspension is still open when the authored pass is
  # dispatched, it ends here, pinned to the head the branch sits at: that head
  # is the approved one or an update-branch merge of it (the only push that
  # still suspends), so it carries the approved content. Leaving it open would
  # let the authored commit be the first head the suspension lifts on — and be
  # latched as the baseline, the exact stamp this function exists to stop.
