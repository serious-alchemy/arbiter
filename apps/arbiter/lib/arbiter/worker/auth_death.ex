defmodule Arbiter.Worker.AuthDeath do
  @moduledoc """
  What happens to a task whose worker died with `:auth_expired` (bd-21bmdh).

  Before this, `Arbiter.Worker.fail_stopped/2` failed the worker, escalated,
  and left the task `:in_progress` behind a `:failed` worker — nothing ever
  returned it to Ready. That was tolerable while a live pre-flight probe
  caught dead credentials before dispatch. bd-2jgs2h retired that probe, so
  an auth death at spawn is now the normal way the fleet finds out, and
  every blip would need a manual reopen. The operator approved the change on
  2026-09-18: **an auth-failed task goes back to Ready**, behind the
  per-provider `Arbiter.Agents.AuthHold`, so it is retried once credentials
  recover instead of stranded. The hold is what keeps this from becoming a
  loop — see its moduledoc.

  `Arbiter.Worker.Driver` calls `handle/4` when it sees its worker `:failed`.
  Any other stop category returns `:not_auth` and the Driver keeps today's
  behaviour exactly. For an auth death, in this order:

    1. **Reclaim the debris.** A worker that never produced a commit leaves a
       worktree and a branch that are nothing but clutter. Both are removed —
       only when no other worker for the task is live, the worktree has no
       uncommitted changes, and the branch has no commits beyond
       `origin/<target>`. Anything else is kept exactly as it was. This runs
       *before* the reopen, so a re-dispatch can never race it for the same
       directory.
    2. **Return the task to Ready.** The `:failed` worker process is stopped
       (its `worker_runs` row stays `:failed`; the board files a card with a
       registered worker under Waiting, not Ready) and the task goes back to
       `:open`. Skipped — today's behaviour — for a review-only engagement, a
       resume / fix-round worker (the resume context would be lost to a fresh
       dispatch), a task no longer `:in_progress`, and a task that has already
       died on auth `AuthHold.max_task_reopens/0` times. That last bound is
       per task and independent of the hold, so no pattern of recoveries can
       cycle one task forever.

  The escalation `fail_stopped/2` sent is unchanged: the first death is still
  reported. It is a ticket-scoped `:worker_stopped`, so the reopen resolves it
  (bd-8if9zt) — the retry is the machine's turn; the credential problem itself
  surfaces through `AuthHold` and the `CredentialWatchdog`.
