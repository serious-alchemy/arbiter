defmodule Arbiter.Worker.Phase do
  @moduledoc """
  What a worker is *actually doing right now*, derived (bd-aw2cyt).

  ## Why a phase and not just a status

  `status` is the worker record's FSM state, and it is honest about the
  record. It is not honest about the work: the main `claude --print` process
  exits when the author agent finishes its turn, but the worker record lives
  on to shepherd the ReviewGate, the implementer rounds, the CI fix passes and
  the merge. Through all of that it reported `:running` (or
  `:awaiting_review_gate`), so the board, `arb worker list` and the MCP tools
  all said "running" about a task with no process anywhere. On 2026-09-16 the
  coordinator saw three such cards at once.

  A phase names the stage instead:

    * `:implementing` — the author's own agent is live.
    * `:in_review` — a ReviewGate reviewer is reading the diff (or the gate is
      between rounds).
    * `:addressing_review` — an implementer round is applying review findings.
    * `:fixing_ci` — a CI fix pass is live.
    * `:resolving_conflict` — a conflict resolver is live.
    * `:waiting_ci_merge` — no agent; an MR is open and CI / the merge queue
      owns the outcome.
    * `:waiting_on_you` — the worker asked a question, or parked failed.
    * `:handing_off` — a live-status record between agents; the brief
      transition window. Also a `:failed` worker carrying
      `meta[:slot_handoff]` — failed only so an automatic round can replace it
      (bd-92mx1m).
    * `:done` — the worker completed.

  ## Phase is not liveness

  `:in_review` says *which stage*; it does not promise a process. The gate can
  be between rounds with nothing spawned. "Is anything burning quota for this
  task" is a separate question — `any_agent_live?/2` — and the two are
  rendered separately on purpose: the board shows the phase as the label and
  the liveness as the card's own emphasis. Slot accounting reads liveness
  only, via `Arbiter.Tasks.SlotGate`.

  ## Compatibility

  `phase` is **additive**. Every surface keeps emitting `status` unchanged, so
  a consumer matching on `:running` / `"running"` keeps working; the phase
  rides alongside it. See `Arbiter.Tasks.SlotGate` for the slot half.

  ## Siblings

  A task's rounds run in *separate* workers: a reviewer / implementer under
  its own synthetic task id (`meta[:reviews]` / `meta[:revises]` points back at
  the author), a fix pass / conflict resolver under the author's task id with
  its own registry key. So an author's phase is a function of its own snapshot
  plus its siblings', and `of/2` takes both. `annotate/1` does the grouping for
  a caller that has the whole list.
