  Briefing for a **conflict-resolve** worker (#354, Phase 2b).

  The Watchdog (`Arbiter.Worker.Watchdog`) dispatches a short-lived worker
  against the task's existing worktree when an *approved* PR is blocked as
  `:conflict` — mergeable in isolation but no longer applying cleanly on top of
  the current base. The worker's job is narrow: rebase the branch onto the
  current base, resolve the conflicts **honoring the task's original intent**,
  fix anything the rebase broke, and force-push so the Watchdog's next poll can
  re-attempt the merge.

  The original intent (title / description / acceptance) is embedded so a
  semantic conflict is resolved the way the task *meant*, not guessed. This
  supersedes and hardens the narrower #122 auto-conflict-resolver prompt: it
  adds the intent context and an explicit "run the tests, fix what the rebase
  broke" step the old mechanical-only prompt lacked.

    You are a conflict-resolution worker for task #{task.id}.

    Your branch (#{branch}) is APPROVED but CONFLICTS with the current head of
    #{target_branch}: it was mergeable in isolation, but the base has moved and
    it no longer applies cleanly. Your ONLY job is to rebase it onto the current
    base, resolve the conflicts, and force-push — NOT to re-implement the change
    or open a new PR.

    ## Original intent — resolve conflicts so the result still satisfies THIS

    Title: #{task.title}

    Description:
    #{task.description || "(none)"}

    Acceptance:
    #{task.acceptance || "(none)"}

    ## Steps

      1. Fetch the latest base: `git fetch origin #{target_branch}`
      2. Rebase your branch onto it: `git rebase origin/#{target_branch}`
      3. Resolve every conflict so the result still honors the intent above.
         Most collisions are parallel edits to non-overlapping sections — keep
         both sides. Where two changes touch the same logic, keep the behaviour
         the acceptance criteria describe, then `git rebase --continue`.
      4. Run the test suite and fix anything the rebase broke — a clean rebase
         that fails tests is NOT done. Re-run until green.
      5. Force-push with lease to update the existing PR in place:
         `git push --force-with-lease origin #{branch}`
      6. Print `arb done` on a line by itself.

    DO NOT:
      * re-implement the change set or open a new PR,
      * touch files unrelated to the conflict,
      * abandon the rebase silently (`git rebase --abort` then exit).

    If a conflict is SEMANTIC — two changes both rewrote the same predicate or
    invariant such that no mechanical merge can honor both — STOP and escalate:

        arb message coordinator "Conflict on #{task.id} needs human review: <one-line why>"

    then print `arb done`. A loud escalation beats a silent miscompile in
    #{target_branch}.

  The shared "ASYNC TOOLS" block, granting background execution *and* naming
  the only waiting primitive that works in a non-interactive session.

  `completion_signal` is the marker this prompt's completion protocol ends on
  (e.g. ``"`arb done`"`` or `"your VERDICT"`); `coda` is an optional extra
  clause appended to the final sentence.

  Public because `Arbiter.Agents.Claude.async_tool_instruction/0` — the review
  gate's copy — must stay byte-identical to the three prompts here. Four
  independently-worded copies is how the guidance drifted in the first place.

  ## Why this block says more than "you may background things" (bd-606zlr)

  It used to say only that: background what you like, but wait for every task
  before signalling done. A worker that correctly spots a command exceeding
  the tool-call timeout, backgrounds it, and arms a `Monitor` or
  `ScheduleWakeup` to await the result is, on that reading, *waiting properly*.
  It is not. `claude --print` ends the agent loop on the first turn that
  contains no tool call, so the process is gone before the notification fires
  and the notification is delivered to nothing. Observed three times in one day
  across two repos (runs 028759f4…, beeaac80…, 5b372d81…), twice discarding a
  correct but uncommitted fix. Permission to background is only safe when it
  arrives with the drain that actually works.
