defmodule Arbiter.Worker.StopReason do
  @moduledoc """
  Classify *why* an worker's agent subprocess stopped.

  This module is the **classification** half of stalled-worker detection
  (bd-awi4nw). Detection itself keys on **process/port liveness** — the worker
  learns the subprocess is gone from the Erlang port's `{:exit_status, n}`
  message (or, for a silent hang, from a no-output watchdog), never from
  scraping stdout for a success/failure pattern. A crashed or flag-rejected
  agent emits nothing useful, so output is not a reliable *stop* signal.

  Once a stop is detected, *this* module looks at the exit status and the tail
  of captured output to put a human-actionable label on it. The exit
  status/signal is authoritative; the output signatures only refine the label
  (e.g. distinguishing an auth-expiry 401 from a generic non-zero crash) so the
  coordinator escalation carries the right remediation.

  ## Categories

    * `:auth_expired` — the agent CLI could not authenticate (401 / "invalid
      authentication credentials" / OAuth expiry). Remediation: re-authenticate.
      Distinct from a generic failure because the fix is operator credentials,
      not the task. Provider-agnostic (Claude OAuth, Gemini API key).
    * `:quota_exhausted` — the Claude CLI's own 5h (or 7d) plan usage-limit
      was reached ("Claude AI usage limit reached", "5-hour limit reached"),
      distinct from `:credit_exhausted` (bd-3hr6g2). Not a billing problem —
      the account has a *time-boxed* allowance that refills on a known
      schedule, so this is provider-imposed throttling, not agent or task
      failure. When the CLI reports a reset timestamp it is parsed into
      `retry_after`; remediation is to wait for the window to reset (or
      switch to a workspace/key not sharing the exhausted plan), never a
      re-dispatch against the same account. Provider-agnostic since bd-a6vh2x:
      Claude's session/weekly limit, agy's `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` quota 429
      (`Resets in 11m34s` parsed into `retry_after`) and grok's free
      Grok Build usage limit all land here. A ticket's own run that stops on
      it is held, not failed: `Arbiter.Worker` opens a timed account hold
      (`Arbiter.Providers.Pause.quota_hold/4`) and queues a resume
      (`Arbiter.Workflows.DispatchQueue`).
    * `:credit_exhausted` — out of credits / insufficient balance / quota /
      billing. Remediation: top up credits or rotate to a funded key.
    * `:rate_limited` — 429 / rate-limit / overloaded / resource exhausted.
      Often transient; remediation is retry/backoff.
    * `:gateway_error` — 502 / 503 / upstream unreachable from the local
      Anthropic proxy (transient network blip between the harness and
      api.anthropic.com). Distinct from a rate-limit or auth failure: the
      session was healthy, the transport layer dropped the request.
      Remediation: auto-resume — the session context is intact, a retry should
      succeed once connectivity recovers.
    * `:context_thrash` — the agent CLI's own autocompact loop detector fired
      ("Autocompact is thrashing: the context refilled to the limit within N
      turns of the previous compact, N times in a row") and the session
      aborted before doing any real work (bd-8cn795). Distinct from a generic
      `:crashed`: the cause is a working set too large for the model's
      context window (whole-file reads of several 500-1100+ line modules, or
      a huge PR body / API dump), not a task or agent bug. Retrying
      identically reproduces it — the remediation is a bigger context window
      or narrower reads, not a re-dispatch.
    * `:memory_cap_exceeded` — the worker's per-spawn memory-capped systemd scope
      (`Arbiter.Worker.MemoryScope`) was OOM-killed (bd-6zuoo6). Synthesized by
      `Arbiter.Worker` from systemd's own `Result=oom-kill` for the scope, never
      by `classify/3`: the exit status is a bare 137, indistinguishable from any
      other SIGKILL. A deliberate refinement of `:killed` — the cause is a
      runaway process tree *inside* the run (almost always a `mix test`), so a
      re-dispatch reproduces it; the remediation is a smaller workload or a
      larger `ARBITER_WORKER_MEMORY_MAX`, not a retry. Not resumable.
    * `:spend_cap` — a `park`-action guardrail tier (`quarantine`, `probation`)
      crossed its token or wall-clock spend cap and
      `Arbiter.Guardrails.SpendPatrol` stopped the run (G19). Built by
      `spend_cap/1`, never by `classify/3`. A policy stop, not an agent failure; not
      resumable, since the cap is per ticket and would trip again.
    * `:trust_suspended` — the run's subject was suspended after a critical
      guardrail event and `Arbiter.Loop.Trust` parked every run of it in flight
      (G18). Built by `trust_suspended/1`, never by `classify/3`. A policy stop;
      not resumable until the coordinator dismisses the suspension.
    * `:killed` — terminated by a signal (the `sh` wrapper reports `128 + N`).
      External kill, OOM, host restart.
    * `:spawn_exec_failed` — non-zero exit with **zero captured output** at
      all — the child never ran, so it never got a chance to write anything.
      The canonical cause (bd-11abk2) is `execve()` failing before the
      process starts: exit 7 is Linux's E2BIG (a spliced argv element, almost
      always the prompt, exceeded the per-argument `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` =
      131 072-byte kernel limit). Distinct from `:crashed` because a crash
      normally leaves *some* stderr; a truly empty capture plus a non-zero
      status points at the exec step itself, not the agent's own logic —
      the remediation is a harness/argv fix, not a task re-dispatch.
    * `:crashed` — non-zero exit with no recognized signature. The
      flag-rejection proof case (`unknown option --reasoning-effort` → immediate
      non-zero exit) lands here unless its stderr matches a more specific
      signature.
    * `:exited_without_done` — clean exit (status 0) but the worker never
      emitted `arb done`. It quit early without completing the task.
    * `:async_wait_abandoned` — a *refinement* of `:exited_without_done`
      (bd-606zlr): the clean exit happened immediately after the agent armed
      an asynchronous wait — a `Monitor`, a `ScheduleWakeup`, or a
      backgrounded `Bash` — and then yielded the turn to await the
      notification. `claude --print` is non-interactive: the agent loop ends
      the instant a turn produces no tool call, so that notification can never
      be delivered — there is no session left to deliver it to. The agent was
      doing the *right* thing (recognising a command that won't finish inside
      the tool-call timeout) with a primitive this harness cannot honour.
      Distinct from a plain early quit because the remediation is a
      `--resume` carrying corrective guidance, never a re-dispatch: the
      worktree usually holds real, uncommitted work.
    * `:permission_denied` — another *refinement* of `:exited_without_done`
      (bd-7wymls), never produced by `classify/3` itself: headless `agy`
      soft-denied a command its `:strict` allowlist does not name and then
      ended the turn, so the model never got to carry on without it.
      `Arbiter.Worker` builds it via `permission_denied/1` from the session's
      structured denial flag (`Arbiter.Worker.ClaudeSession.denial_ended_turn?/1`),
      not from the output tail. Resumable: the conversation is intact and the
      remediation is a `--conversation` resume telling the model the command
      was denied.
    * `:stalled` — no exit at all; the subprocess is alive within the watchdog
      window (caller passes `exit_status: nil`). The summary distinguishes a
      wholly silent subprocess from one that was mid-flight: "produced no
      output" is a *finding*, not a synonym for "timed out" (bd-svczq4).
    * `:preflight_timeout` — the dispatch's auth **pre-flight probe** (not a
      worker) outran its watchdog. Synthesized by
      `Arbiter.Agents.Preflight`, never by `classify/2`: there is no worker,
      no transcript and no work in progress, so it carries its own summary
      (elapsed, watchdog, whether any output arrived) and a remediation that
      names the probe's own config rather than sending the operator to a
      transcript that does not exist (bd-svczq4).
    * `:missing_worktree` — the worker signalled `arb done` on a reviewable
      code directive but no per-task branch/worktree was ever provisioned, so
      there is nothing to integrate (bd-7pe74i). Not a subprocess-exit
      classification — synthesized by the completion path to refuse closing a
      task that produced no deliverable. Remediation: investigate why
      provisioning was skipped, then re-dispatch.
    * `:tampered_clone` — the worker signalled `arb done` but the private clone's
      `.git` is no longer the directory the clone was created with: it renamed it
      and put its own in place (bd-6t7u81). Synthesized by the completion path,
      never by `classify/2`. A replacement `.git` carries a config the host's git
      would act on (`core.fsmonitor`, a hook, a diff driver), so the tree is not
      diffed, reviewed or merged: the original `.git` is put back and the run
      fails for the coordinator.
    * `:workspace_destroyed` — the worker's workspace **was** provisioned and
      then vanished from disk while the run was alive (bd-b6noq9). The exact
      opposite of `:missing_worktree`: there was a worktree, a branch and work
      in progress, and the directory holding them is simply gone. Synthesized
      by the completion and stop paths, never by `classify/2` — the exit status
      of a subprocess whose cwd was deleted says nothing useful.

      Called out separately because both of the generic outcomes are actively
      wrong here. `commit_gate/1` gates on `File.dir?(worktree)` and fails
      *open*, so a destroyed workspace used to route to the review gate /
      merger like a healthy completion and surface as a free-text "merge
      failed" page; and `:exited_without_done` is *resumable*, so the worker
      would respawn `claude --resume` into a directory that no longer exists.
      Remediation is neither re-dispatch-as-is nor resume: the branch may have
      existed only inside the destroyed root, so the first question is whether
      any copy of the work survives (a pushed remote, another checkout) before
      the task is re-run from scratch.
    * `:agent_print_timeout` — the `agy` (Gemini fork) CLI's own internal
      print-mode turn timeout fired mid-turn ("print timeout … with turn in
      progress; returning partial output") and agy returned whatever partial
      output it had — with a `result.status` of `"SUCCESS"` (bd-1xss5z). A
      turn that was cut off is not a successful one no matter what agy's own
      terminal event claims, so this is trusted even on a clean (status 0)
      exit, the same way `:stream_schema_drift` is: the marker is agy's own
      fixed harness wording, not model prose that could coincidentally
      appear in a real review's output.
    * `:spawn_failed` — a step of `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.dispatch/2` AFTER
      `start_worker/3` failed (e.g. a transient network/VPN outage during the
      agent subprocess spawn, or a workflow-machine attach failure). Not a
      subprocess-exit classification — there is no port/process to exit,
      since the agent never got a chance to start (bd-bi5pn0). Distinct from
      `:exited_without_done`, which covers a port that opened then exited
      early. Synthesized by `Dispatch.dispatch/2` itself so the worker it just
      registered `:idle` does not zombie with no retry/escalate. Remediation:
      investigate the dispatch error (often transient connectivity), then
      re-dispatch.

  ## Provider-agnostic signatures

  The auth / credit / rate-limit signatures are matched case-insensitively
  against the captured output and cover both the Claude CLI and the
  Gemini/`agy` CLIs (e.g. Gemini's `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, `API key not valid`).
  They are intentionally broad: a false *refinement* (labelling a crash as
  rate-limited) is far cheaper than burying an auth-expiry as a generic
  failure.

  bd-35ujxv: "broad" stops at tool-result content. A worker whose own task is
  Arbiter itself routinely runs `mix test`, which logs fixture scenarios
  containing this exact vocabulary verbatim ("API Error: 401 Invalid
  authentication credentials", "AuthHold: Claude dispatch hold OPEN") — that
  is the *worker's own Bash tool output*, not evidence its own session hit an
  auth failure. A worker whose session otherwise ended normally was
  misclassified `:auth_expired` from this, reopening its task and counting
  toward the fleet-wide `AuthHold` streak. `signature_haystack/1` excludes
  every line a display-line producer tagged as tool-result content (the "⏴ "
  glyph prefix, applied to the header AND every body line) before any
  signature regex below runs. A provider's *own* auth/quota/credit/rate-limit
  failure is never reported as a tool result — it surfaces as the CLI's own
  `result` event, assistant text, or raw stderr — so a genuine failure is
  unaffected.

  # bd-3hr6g2: the Claude CLI's own plan usage-limit message, distinct from a
  # billing/credit failure — this is a time-boxed allowance, not an account
  # balance. Checked ahead of @credit_signature so "usage limit reached" isn't
  # swallowed by the generic quota wording below (it wouldn't match anyway,
  # but ordering keeps the two signatures independent as either evolves).
  # The CLI appends the reset time as a unix-epoch-seconds after a `|`
  # (`"Claude AI usage limit reached|1735689600"`); parsed opportunistically
  # by `retry_after_from/1` — its absence just means no reset time is known.
  #
  # bd-3wgdie: the bare phrase is NOT anchored — a worker whose last 80 output
  # lines happen to include a tool result or file read that quotes/discusses
  # this exact wording (e.g. this very module's docstring, or a grep hit) would
  # otherwise false-match and pay a 5h+ park instead of a fast fail (the
  # `:quota_exhausted` remediation is "wait", not "re-dispatch", so a false hit
  # is expensive). Require the phrase to lead its line (only whitespace before
  # it, as the CLI actually emits it standalone) UNLESS the `|<epoch>` reset
  # suffix is present, which is specific enough on its own — real prose
  # discussing the message doesn't happen to append a matching unix timestamp.
  #
  # bd-6dxit2: the CLI's current wording for the same condition is
  # `You've hit your session limit · resets 4:50am (America/New_York)` — it
  # never says "usage limit reached" any more. Runs refused this way exit 1
  # within a second having emitted three lines, so before this alternative was
  # added they classified as `:crashed`: a generic non-zero exit whose
  # remediation is "re-dispatch". That misroute is what made ReviewGate re-prompt
  # a reviewer that could not run and then report "no parseable VERDICT line"
  # (the reviewer's fault) instead of "the account is out of 5h allowance".
  # Any apostrophe form the CLI may emit is accepted (`.{0,3}` spans a plain
  # `'` or a 3-byte UTF-8 `\u2019`; the regex carries no /u flag), and the line-leading
  # anchor from bd-3wgdie applies here too so quoting this wording in source or
  # tool output cannot buy a 5h park.
  # bd-cfhj7z: the four `usage limit reached` alternatives are RETAINED, kept
  # defensively rather than confirmed still-live — a scan of every run in the
  # live DB whose tail contains "limit reached" (14 runs, 2026-07-07..2026-09-09)
  # turned up no CLI emission of that wording at line start, only Arbiter's own
  # log line and workers grepping this repo's fixtures. Absence of a recent hit
  # is not proof an older pinned CLI build never emits it, so they stay.

  # bd-cfhj7z: the CLI build seen in run 7e9e5ea5 reports the reset as a

  # (`resets 3:30am (America/New_York)`) rather than the `|<epoch>` suffix
  # `@quota_reset_signature` knows. `retry_after_from/1` therefore returned nil
  # and `Arbiter.Worker.quota_resume_backoff_ms/1` fell back to its blanket 5h
  # default — parking a worker and its worktree for five hours even when the
  # window was ten minutes from resetting.
  #
  # The reset clause is only read off the CLI's own phrase line (the same
  # bd-3wgdie line-leading anchor `@quota_signature` uses). Reading it from
  # anywhere in the tail would let prose that merely mentions a reset time
  # *shorten* a park, which is the more dangerous direction of the two.
  #
  # Review round 1, finding 2: nothing after the meridiem is parsed *inside* this
  # regex. Any bounded zone-name class — an IANA-shaped one, or even raw
  # `[^)\n]{1,40}` — makes the trailing group optional in practice: a rendering
  # it cannot span (`(UTC-04:00)`, a non-ASCII dash, an unclosed or overlong
  # parenthetical) fails the group, leaves `zone` empty, and silently takes the
  # "no zone named, assume host-local" path — applying *this* host's offset to a
  # wall clock that may have been written somewhere else, in either direction.
  # So the regex captures the whole remainder of the line as `tail` and
  # `zone_from_tail/1` decides: empty tail means no zone was named (host-local),
  # a closed `(...)` yields whatever is between the parens for
  # `host_zone_matches?/1` to accept or reject, and anything else declines the

  @doc """
  Classify a stop from the subprocess exit status and captured output.

  `exit_status` is the integer the Erlang port reported, or `nil` when the
  subprocess is still alive (a no-output stall detected by the watchdog).

  `output_lines` is the captured stdout/stderr, **newest-first or oldest-first**
  — order does not matter, we only scan the tail for signatures. Pass the
  worker's `meta[:output_lines]` (oldest-first) directly.

  `provider` (bd-1zz5mn) is the session's provider string (e.g. `"gemini"`,
  `"codex"`, `nil`/`"claude"`) — it selects which adapter's
  `async_arm_signature/0` is used to recognize an abandoned async wait.
  Defaults to `nil`, which resolves to the Claude signature, so every
  existing caller that doesn't know its provider (or doesn't care — the
  async-wait refinement is the only thing that's provider-shaped) is
  unaffected.

  Returns a `%StopReason{}`.

  # bd-cfhj7z: no tz database is bundled (the umbrella has neither :tzdata nor

  # "America/New_York"). We do not need one: the CLI renders that wall clock in
  # *its own host's* local zone, and its host is this host — so the offset we
  # need is the one the BEAM already gets from the OS's zoneinfo via
  # `NaiveDateTime.local_now/0`.
  #
  # That equivalence is asserted, not assumed: when the message names a zone we
  # only use the local offset if that name matches the host's configured zone
  # (TZ, then the /etc/localtime symlink, then /etc/timezone). A mismatch — or
  # a host whose zone we cannot name — yields nil, which is the pre-existing
  # "no reset time reported" path, not a wrong one.
  #
  # Known bound: if a DST transition falls between now and the reset, the
  # current offset is off by up to an hour. That is a ≤1h error twice a year
  # against a 5h blanket default, and `quota_resume_backoff_ms/1` clamps the
  # result to a 60s floor, so the failure mode is one early retry, not a hang.
  #
  # Review round 1, finding 1: `classify/2` runs at *session exit*, not when the
  # CLI printed the phrase, and the two can be far apart (`claude session error
  # 674.5s` in the very run this ticket cites). If the reset instant falls
  # inside that gap, a naive "always the next occurrence" roll turns a window
  # that has ALREADY reset into a ~24h park -- strictly worse than the 5h
  # default it replaces. Two bounds prevent that, both resting on the fact that
  # this wording only ever describes the 5h window (a 7-day reset carries a
  # date, which `@quota_reset_wallclock_signature` cannot match):
  #
  #   * `@wallclock_past_slack_seconds` -- a candidate less than an hour behind
  #     the local clock is the reset we just missed, not tomorrow's. It is
  #     returned in the past, so `Arbiter.Worker.quota_resume_backoff_ms/1`
  #     takes its 60s floor and the worker retries promptly. A wasted retry
  #     costs one re-detect; a wrong day costs a day.
  #   * `@wallclock_max_horizon_seconds` -- any reset that survives the roll but
  #     lands further out than the window itself means the date guess was wrong,
  #     so we decline entirely and the pre-existing 5h default stands. That
  #     makes the wall-clock path never worse than the behaviour before this
  #     branch, in either direction.
