defmodule Arbiter.Worker.ClaudeSession do
  @moduledoc """
  Port wrapper that runs a child process (eventually Claude Code CLI) inside a
  worktree and streams its stdout into a parent `Arbiter.Worker` GenServer.

  This is Phase 2's I/O surface for the worker. **No tmux** — we drive Claude
  Code (or any echo-script spike) directly through an Erlang `Port` so the
  parent process sees output line-by-line and can react to completion signals
  without polling a tty.

  ## Architecture

      caller (the worker)
        │
        ▼
      ClaudeSession.start(opts)
        │   (synchronous GenServer.call to the owner worker)
        ▼
      worker handle_call(:__start_session__)
        │   Port.open/2 — worker becomes the port owner
        ▼
      worker handle_info({port, ...})
        │   • append line to meta[:output_lines]   (cap @line_cap)
        │   • Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast {:worker_output, task_id, line}
        │   • on "arb done" → Worker.complete(self())
        │   • on {:exit_status, n} → meta[:exit_status], broadcast :worker_exited
        ▼

  We deliberately open the `Port` *from inside* the worker's process (via a
  GenServer.call hop) so the worker itself owns the port. Port messages only
  flow to the port owner; if `ClaudeSession.start/1` opened the port in the
  caller process and then tried to hand it over, we'd race ownership transfer
  against early child output. The GenServer.call hop is synchronous from the
  caller's perspective and avoids that footgun.

  ## Invocation & streaming

  Real Claude runs use `claude --print <prompt> --output-format stream-json
  --verbose`, wrapped in `sh -c 'exec "$@" < /dev/null'` so the child's stdin
  is closed immediately (otherwise the CLI prints a "no stdin data received in
  3s" warning that pollutes the transcript). The prompt is passed as a literal
  positional parameter to `sh`, never interpolated into the command string, so
  there is no shell-injection surface.

  `--output-format stream-json` emits one JSON event per line (JSONL): a
  `system`/`init` header, one `assistant` event per turn (text + tool calls),
  `user` events carrying tool results, and a final `result` summary. We parse
  each line and emit human-readable display lines so the UI tails the session
  in near-real-time instead of waiting for the whole run to flush at exit.

  Lines that don't parse as a stream-json event (test echo scripts, non-Claude
  spikes, stray stderr) fall through unchanged to the raw-line path, so the
  PubSub/line-cap plumbing behaves identically for them.

  ## Completion detection

  A display line matching `~r/\\barb done[^\\p{L}\\p{N}]*$/u` triggers
  `Worker.complete/2`. The marker must be the **last** token on the line
  (only whitespace / punctuation / decoration may trail it), so a literal
  marker line like `arb done`, `>> arb done <<`, or a turn ending in
  `… — arb done` trips it, but a prose line that merely *mentions* the marker
  mid-sentence ("I'll print arb done when the tests pass") does NOT (bd-7a0pi8:
  a worker narrating its intent to finish must not falsely complete before it
  has done the work). The leading `\\b` still rejects the "arb doneness"
  substring. Under stream-json, detection is additionally scoped to the
  worker's **assistant text** (and the raw-line fallback): tool calls and tool
  *results* are displayed but never trip completion, so an worker that greps
  or cats "arb done" mid-task can't falsely complete itself.

  ## Output buffering

  We keep at most `#{1000}` recent lines in `meta[:output_lines]` to avoid
  unbounded memory growth on chatty children. The list is stored newest-first
  for O(1) prepend; flip with `Enum.reverse/1` for display. The cap is
  arbitrary; reviewers should weigh it against expected Claude session length.
  No back-pressure to the child — we never block on slow consumers.

  ## Durable transcript

  The capped buffer above is for *liveness* — it bounds memory and feeds the
  UI tail. For audit, every emitted line is *also* appended, uncapped, to a
  per-run on-disk transcript via `Arbiter.Worker.OutputLog`, when the session
  was opened with an `:output_log` handle (the worker opens one keyed on the
  run id). This durable capture sits alongside the live path and never gates
  it: a session opened without a handle behaves exactly as before.

  ## PubSub topic

  Default topic is `"worker:" <> task_id`. Subscribers (LiveView, CLI
  followers, tests) must know the task_id to subscribe. The `:topic` opt
  overrides this.

  Builds the session-config map that every site opening a worker port must
  stash alongside the port.

  Three sites open ports for the same task — `start/1` here, plus the gate-nudge
  and auto-resume respawns in `Arbiter.Worker` — and each respawn inherits the
  original port's `:env`, secrets included. Any field missing from a respawn's
  map silently degrades that session: a missing `:redact_values` (bd-62d3jh)
  means the relaunched child can echo a secret straight through `redact_line/2`
  to the PubSub stream, `worker_runs.output_lines`, and the durable log. This
  constructor is the single owner of the shape, so a new field can't drift out
  of two of the three callers.

  ## Options

    * `:provider` / `:model` — routing config for the session's adapter.
    * `:redact_values` — secret worker env values to scrub from output. Resolved
      from the task's workspace when omitted; pass the previous session's list
      on a respawn to skip the redundant DB read.
    * `:composed_prompt` — the raw prompt text this spawn was built from
      (bd-9rdwe4, #1017 gap G5), carried purely for durable persistence
      (`Arbiter.Worker.PromptLog`) — it plays no role in argv construction.
      A caller that already built its own argv (`command:` opts, e.g.
      `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch` / `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate`) should still
      pass the prompt string it composed here so the worker can record what
      the agent was actually told.

  Start a Claude (or echo-spike) session in `worktree_path`, streaming output
  into the `:owner` worker.

  ## Required opts

    * `:worktree_path` — absolute path, must exist. The child runs with this
      as cwd.
    * `:owner` — pid of the parent worker GenServer. Becomes the port owner
      and receives all port messages.

  ## Optional opts

    * `:prompt` — passed to Claude as the prompt. Required when `:command`
      is `nil` (real Claude invocation).
    * `:command` — full argv list as `[exec, arg1, arg2, ...]`. When set,
      overrides the default streaming `claude` invocation and is spawned
      verbatim (no `sh`/stdin wrapping). Tests **must** pass this so we don't
      shell out to real Claude.
    * `:topic` — PubSub topic to broadcast output on. Defaults to
      `"worker:" <> task_id`.
    * `:security` — the spawn's resolved `Arbiter.Agents.SecurityPolicy`. A
      `sandbox.backend: podman` policy runs the child in a container
      (`Arbiter.Worker.ContainerSpawn`; also `:workspace`, `:repo` and, for tests,
      `:image`, `:podman` and `:egress`) and fails the start rather than run it
      unsandboxed. Any other policy leaves the spawn as it was.

  ## Returns

    * `{:ok, port}` on success. The port is owned by the `:owner` worker.
    * `{:error, reason}` if the executable can't be resolved or the worktree
      path is invalid.

  # lands on a delta boundary (e.g. `"VERDICT: REQUEST_"` / `"CHANGES\n..."`)
  # would render as two broken lines that never share a line with each other,
  # so `ReviewGate`'s `^VERDICT:` regex could not see it on either half. This
  # is a real, reproducible gap (see the unit tests below), confirmed
  # independently of any specific incident. It is NOT confirmed to be the
  # cause of the bd-atyrrq / run-72947341 incident this bug was filed
  # against: re-parsing that run's captured durable transcript verbatim with
  # `ReviewGate.parse_verdict/1` succeeds today with no buffering change at
  # all (its `VERDICT: REQUEST_CHANGES` line is intact, unsplit, at column 0),
  # and its preamble/closing lines (bare `⚙ gemini session started`, the
  # uppercase-status `⚙ gemini session SUCCESS · …` summary) match the `agy`
  # fork's event schema, not this one — `agy`'s assistant text already had
  # per-line buffering before this change (`buffer_gemini_display/2`'s
  # `"event" => "step_update"` clause above, live since bd-2fzwlc). What
  # actually made ReviewGate report `:no_verdict` for that specific run is
  # still open, and it is NOT a `reviewer_run_id/1` resolution miss: the dev
  # DB (`worker_runs`) has exactly one row for task_id `bd-atyrrq#review`
  # (id `72947341-…`, started_at 22:20:47Z) — no tie, no ambiguity — and
  # `reviewer_run_id/1`'s query resolves it cleanly today. A second row,
  # `bd-atyrrq#review#v2` (id `f752e0c6-…`, started 22:25:47Z, ~5 min later —
  # the length of the first pass's own session), is Arbiter's own verdict
  # re-prompt firing, which means the FIRST pass's parse genuinely returned
  # `:no_verdict` at the time in production, against a transcript that parses
  # cleanly today with none of this change's buffering involved. That
  # re-prompt pass's own durable transcript (`f752e0c6-….log`) then stalled
  # waiting on a background `mix precommit` task and closed with no verdict
  # of its own — a second, independent failure, not a repeat of the first.
  # So the surviving question — why the first pass's parse missed a verdict
  # that both `parse_verdict/1` and the durable-transcript fallback (live
  # since bd-6dxit2, 3 days before this incident) handle correctly today —
  # has no artifact left to answer it: no PubSub timing, and no record of
  # which coordinator build was actually running that pass. A non-delta
  # message (`"delta"` absent/false) is already a complete, standalone
  # utterance (see the plain-content test cases), so it flushes immediately
  # rather than waiting on a DONE marker this schema does not have; any
  # leftover buffered text from a *prior* incomplete delta run is flushed as
  # its own line(s) first, rather than glued onto the new message with no

  # not a reliable signal (a DONE step with no output in that capture, an

  #     auto-denied. …` — see `note_agy_denial_notice/2`.

  # the port exit to resume the SAME conversation with a corrective prompt

  # bd-crqku8: always inject ARB_WORKER_BEAD_ID so any `arb restart/update/
  # start` invoked from inside the worker session can detect it and refuse,
  # preventing an worker from bouncing the live orchestrating server.
  #
  # bd-4hkzn3: prepend release-env cleanup pairs so ROOTDIR / BINDIR /
  # RELEASE_* inherited from the systemd OTP release service unit are unset in
  # every worker child shell. Without this, `mix test` (and `arb inbox`) in a
  # worktree tries to boot from the release's ERTS rather than the
  # per-worktree mise-pinned toolchain, crashing with a missing boot file and
  # forcing the ReviewGate to static-analysis-only. The cleanup pairs are a
  # no-op on a plain dev VM (ReleaseEnv.clean_pairs/0 returns [] when no
  # release vars are detected). Caller-explicit `:env` is appended after the
  # cleanup so it can always override specific vars if needed.
  #
  # bd-bzsqbu: also prepend a task-scoped DATABASE_PATH override so a worker
  # that starts its own `mix phx.server` for manual verification writes into
  # a throwaway sqlite file instead of silently inheriting the coordinator's
  # own DATABASE_PATH — the same file the live `arbiter.service` uses.
  #
  # `worker_env` is the workspace's user-defined vars (bd-62d3jh), resolved by
  # the caller so one workspace load serves both it and the session's
  # `redact_values`. They sit after the release/dev-server cleanups but before
  # caller-explicit `:env` (agent auth) and the always-last ARB_WORKER_BEAD_ID
  # guard, so a user var can never clobber the agent's auth or the
  # self-recursion guard.
  # bd-asawcq: `/api` needs a bearer token, so the agent's own `arb` gets the
  # worker token its dispatch minted (`Dispatch.inject_mcp_config/3`) as
