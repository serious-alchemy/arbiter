defmodule Arbiter.Worker.ResumeContext do
  @moduledoc """
  Build the "work so far" briefing for a **resumed** worker (bd-auma3z).

  When a worker is stopped mid-work (token exhaustion, crash, kill) its
  per-task git worktree is preserved on disk: any commits it
  made are on the branch, and any in-flight edits sit uncommitted in the tree.
  Re-dispatching from scratch would discard that history from the agent's context
  and risk redoing or duplicating completed steps.

  This module reads the **git state of the preserved worktree** and renders a
  Markdown prefix that is prepended to the standard work prompt by
  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch`. The resumed (fresh) agent reads it and continues
  from where the prior one left off.

  ## Provider-agnostic by construction

  The briefing is plain text derived from `git` — no Claude/Gemini session id,
  no provider `--resume` flag. Any agent, on any provider, gets the same
  worktree-state summary. This is the deliberate design choice (coordinator sign-off
  2026-06-05): approach (b) — reattach a fresh agent to the preserved worktree
  with a git-derived briefing — over approach (a) provider session-resume.

  ## What's in the briefing

    * **Commits since the branch was cut** — `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD`,
      so the agent sees the completed, committed work.
    * **Uncommitted changes** — `git status --porcelain` plus a bounded
      `git diff HEAD`, so the agent sees in-flight edits that were never
      committed (the most common stop state).

  Both are bounded so a large diff can't blow up the prompt: the diff is capped
  at `@max_diff_lines` lines.

  Render just the git-state "work so far" briefing — the commits made since the
  branch was cut plus any uncommitted work-in-progress — as a Markdown block,
  WITHOUT the surrounding resume framing.

  Split out of `build/3` so callers other than the `arb resume` path can reuse
  the same git-derived continuity briefing. The ReviewGate's revise-and-rediscuss
  loop (bd-1na62i, Stage 3) prepends it to a revise-round implementer: between
  review rounds the prior round's fixes are committed on the branch (and any
  stragglers sit uncommitted), and the fresh implementer mind needs that picture
  to *continue the thread* rather than re-derive it from a raw diff. This is the
  provider-agnostic same-mind-continuity approximation Stage 3 settled on — git
  state, not a Claude/Gemini session-resume id.
