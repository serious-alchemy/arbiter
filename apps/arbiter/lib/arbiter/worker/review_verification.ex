      the same as a criterion being met: a test can assert against a test-local
      helper or stub instead of the real serializer / code path the criterion
      names, or exercise a feature that is inert in production. Trace each
      criterion to the real behaviour and cite where it is delivered.
    - If the implementer declared a limitation, deferral, or "out of scope" that
      touches a stated criterion, that criterion is `[NOT MET]` — do not launder
      a declared gap into an approval.
    - Do NOT mark a criterion `[MET]` unless you verified it against the CURRENT
