defmodule Arbiter.Usage do
  @moduledoc """
  Ash domain + aggregation API for the structured token/cost usage ledger.

  Every Claude session — work worker, ReviewGate reviewer, or ReviewGate
  implementer — emits a final `result` event carrying tokens (input / output /
  cache), `total_cost_usd`, `duration_ms`, and model. The worker captures that
  and inserts an `Arbiter.Usage.Event` row keyed by task + step
  (`:work | :review | :impl`) + `workspace_id` (always the authoring task's
  workspace — see `Arbiter.Worker.effective_workspace_id/1` — even for
  reviewer/implementer rows, whose worker carries `workspace_id: nil` for
  unrelated notification-suppression reasons) and `worker_run_id` for
  joinability.

  Multiple rows per task are deliberate: a re-slung task writes a second
  `:work` row, a ReviewGate review adds a `:review` row, etc. Rework is then
  visible as the spend across rows for the same task.

  Not every row has a task, though. Since bd-adyhvn `task_id` is nullable and
  every row carries a `source` (`:task | :probe | :preflight |
  :coordinator_session | :terminal_session | :maintenance`), so the dispatch
  auth pre-flight and future coordinator / terminal sessions land here too —
  see `Arbiter.Usage.Event` and `Arbiter.Usage.Probe`. (`:probe` was the quota
  `RefreshProbe`'s source before it was deleted, bd-atyrrq — historical rows
  may still carry it.)

  ## Aggregation

  `summarize/1` rolls events up by one of `:day`, `:task`, `:epic`,
  `:workspace`, `:repo`, `:model`, `:step`, `:provider`, `:source`, or
  `:session`. It returns a list
  of maps with `{group:, total_cost_usd:, tokens_in:, tokens_out:, ...}`.
  `:campaign` (the old name for `:epic`) is still accepted as a deprecated
  alias — see `summarize/1` below.

  The CLI (`arb usage`) and Phoenix endpoint (`GET /api/usage`) sit on top of
  this. Anything new (per-day burn dashboards, budget routing) should call
  `summarize/1` rather than re-doing SQL.

  ## Estimation (bd-3j4ch4)

  `summarize/1` answers "what has been spent". `estimate_for_issue/2` answers
  the forward-looking question — "what will this task cost?" — from the same
  ledger, as a percentile range over comparable closed tasks, and
  `calibration/1` reports which closed tasks' actual costs say their
  difficulty rating was wrong. Both delegate to `Arbiter.Usage.Estimate`,
  which owns the window, the grouping ladder and the data-hygiene rules;
  they are re-exported here so callers have one door into the ledger.

  Roll up usage events into a list of summary rows.

  ## Options

    * `:by` — one of `#{inspect(@valid_by)}` (`:campaign` also accepted as a
      deprecated alias for `:epic`; `:account` accepted as an alias for
      `:provider_account`, the spelling `docs/provider-account-design.md`
      §8 and the CLI/REST docs use). Required.
    * `:since` — `%DateTime{}` filter on `occurred_at`. Optional.
    * `:workspace_id` — restrict to one workspace. Optional.
    * `:provider_account_id` — restrict to one provider account
      (`docs/provider-account-design.md` §3.3, §8). Filters
      `usage_events.provider_account_id` directly (P9), so it is exact with
      every grouping — including rows with no `workspace_id` at all (a probe
      or pre-flight row has no workspace but always has an account). Optional.
    * `:session_ids` — restrict to a list of `session_id` values, pushed into
      the query as `session_id in ^ids` rather than filtered after the read.
      `Event` indexes `:session_id`, so this keeps a `:by :session` rollup for
      a handful of known sessions (e.g. `/sessions`' live-refresh tick) an
      indexed lookup instead of a full-table read. Optional.
    * `:limit` — cap the returned rows (after sort). Optional.

  Returns `{:ok, [rollup]}` or `{:error, reason}`. Rows are sorted by
  `total_cost_usd` desc (or chronologically for `:by :day`).

  `:epic` groups by a task's `:parent_of` parent(s) — a task with more than
  one parent is counted in each, mirroring the parent-with-progress rollup.
  Tasks with *no* parent don't disappear; they fall into the catch-all sentinel
  `(no_epic)` so spend isn't silently lost.

  ## Task-less rows (bd-adyhvn)

  Rows whose `source` isn't `:task` carry a `nil` `task_id` — quota probes,
  auth pre-flights, coordinator / terminal sessions. `:task` is the one
  grouping that **drops** them: a rollup keyed by task must not grow a `nil`
  or sentinel group for spend that belongs to no task. Every other grouping
  counts them, so `:day`, `:workspace`, `:provider` and `:source` totals are
  the real consumption. Use `:source` to see the split.

  `:session` is the mirror image of `:task`: it groups by `session_id` and
  **drops** rows that carry none (i.e. everything but `coordinator_session` /
  `terminal_session` sources), the same "don't invent a phantom group"
  discipline `:task` already applies (§7.6 of
  `docs/browser-hosted-coordinator-sessions.md`).

  @doc """
  Providers whose `usage_events` rows are **wholly** zero-or-unknown-token
  over the window — i.e. no row for that provider carries any reported
  token count.

  A provider whose stream parser silently drops usage (bd-2fzwlc: this is
  exactly what happened to every Gemini/agy row before the fix) reads
  identically to "that provider is just cheap" unless something calls this
  out. A provider with even one row carrying real tokens is not flagged —
  this is a blindness detector, not a low-usage alert.

  Every flagged row is one of two shapes, counted separately (bd-96mn8i
  round 2, finding 3):

    * **literal zero** (`zero_rows`) — `tokens_in`/`tokens_out` are both the
      number `0`. This is the actual "parser bug" signature: the provider's
      stream reported a terminal event and the parser read nothing out of
      it.
    * **unknown** (`unknown_rows`) — `tokens_in`/`tokens_out` are both `nil`,
      meaning no usage was recorded at all (e.g. a failed probe that never
      reached a terminal event). This is an honest gap, not a parser bug,
      and callers must word it differently — folding it into "zero" here is
      exactly the bug this function exists to catch, one level up: after
      bd-96mn8i's fix, a window of legitimately-failed probes would
      otherwise re-raise "likely a stream parser silently dropping usage"
      against data that is already correct.

  Accepts the same `:since` / `:workspace_id` options as `summarize/1`, plus
  `:until` (`%DateTime{}`, filters `occurred_at <= until`) so a historical
  window's flag reflects only the rows the window actually covers.
  Returns `{:ok, [%{provider:, rows:, zero_rows:, unknown_rows:}]}`, sorted
