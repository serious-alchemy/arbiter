defmodule Arbiter.Reviews.PrState do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolution and retry logic for an `ExternalReview` record's `pr_state`
  (bd-3jjk0e).

  Historically pr_state was resolved *only* by the dashboard LiveView, lazily on
  render, with a coarse `open | merged | closed | unknown` vocabulary in which
  `"unknown"` was a dead-end: once written it was never re-polled, so a single
  transient failure froze a row forever. This module is the single source of
  truth for both the resolution and the "should I re-poll this?" decision, shared
  by three callers:

    * the dashboard LiveView (a *reader* that also opportunistically resolves),
    * the review `complete` path (`Arbiter.Reviews.ExternalReview`), and
    * the background poller (`Arbiter.Reviews.PrStatePoller`), which keeps
      pr_state advancing even when no dashboard is open.

  ## State vocabulary

  The persisted `pr_state` string is one of:

    * `"open"`    — live PR, still open (retry: it may still merge/close).
    * `"merged"`  — terminal.
    * `"closed"`  — terminal.
    * `"gone"`    — soft-terminal; the adapter reported 404 on
                    `@not_found_confirm_threshold` consecutive checks. Not
                    re-polled by the normal cadence, but re-opened for one
                    more verification pass once its confirmation (`gone_at`)
                    goes stale (bd-7qzqfs) — a GitHub token can transiently
                    lack read access and 404 (not 403) to avoid leaking a
                    private resource's existence, so a single 404 is never
                    proof of deletion.
    * `"n/a"`     — terminal; there is no forge PR to poll (a `direct`-strategy
                    review, or a blank strategy / ref).
    * `"unknown"` — a *transient* failure (network, 5xx, rate-limit, token/config
                    not resolvable, or an unconfirmed 404). Retryable — the
                    next tick re-resolves it.

  `nil` means "never resolved yet" and is also retryable.

  `:error` on any failure (never raises).

  `"not_found"` signal is committed as terminal `"gone"` or held at retryable
  `"unknown"` pending another confirmation. Any other outcome resets the
