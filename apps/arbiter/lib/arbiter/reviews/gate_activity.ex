defmodule Arbiter.Reviews.GateActivity do
  @moduledoc """
  Is a fleet-authored PR's task currently inside the `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate`?

  bd-bq8c8a / #1860. On 2026-09-17 two arbiter components wrote to one task
  branch inside thirty seconds. `Arbiter.Workflows.PRPatrol` saw two unresolved
  Copilot threads on PR #424 — a PR the fleet had authored and whose task was
  still waiting on the review gate — filed a follow-up, and its fix
  worker committed and pushed `aed4457` to `origin/<branch>`. The gate's own
  round-1 implementer committed `19665a3` on the worktree twenty seconds later,
  its push was rejected `:diverged`, and the task parked `head_not_pushed`.
  Neither component knew the other was on the branch.

  The operator cannot configure this away: `pr_patrol.author_logins` is scoped
  to the fleet identity *precisely so* patrol answers review threads on fleet
  PRs. So the patrol has to ask the question instead, and this module is the
  question: while the gate holds a branch, the gate is the authority on the
  diff, and nothing else may commit to it.

  ## What counts as "inside the gate"

  Three signals, any one of which gates the PR:

    * `:author_in_review` — the authoring run is `:waiting` on the review
      gate (bd-1uu19b; `Arbiter.Worker.awaiting_review_gate?/1`). This is the whole gate lifetime, from the moment the author hands
      off until a verdict lands, and it is the signal that would have caught
      the reported incident.
    * `:round_running` — a reviewer or implementer worker is registered for the
      task (`meta.reviews` / `meta.revises`). Redundant with the above in the
      normal case, but it still fires if the author's registration is missing —
      an ad-hoc gate, a re-run gate, a restarted author.
    * `:ticket_review_parked` — the gate gave up and parked the ticket
      (`Arbiter.Tasks.ReviewPark` — the park is its attention cause). The branch is mid-incident and a human owns
      it; a patrol commit landing on top is exactly what made the reported
      recovery manual.

  There is a fourth answer, `:undeterminable`, which is not a signal but the
  absence of one: the read that would have answered the question failed. It
  gates the PR too — see "Failure posture" below.

  ## Failure posture — fail closed

  §5.2 of `docs/review-coverage-and-guard-policy.md` assigns the posture by
  what the guard protects: fail closed when the guard "cannot decide, do not
  take the irreversible action", and that applies "to guards that protect
  *authorisation* — merging, **filing**, publishing". This guard authorises
  filing a follow-up whose worker then commits and pushes to a branch, so it
  is fail-closed by that definition.

  The asymmetry is stark. Failing closed costs one patrol tick (~60s): the
  hold is a skip, not a give-up — nothing is written, nothing is consumed, the
  threads stay unresolved, and the next tick asks again. Failing open costs a
  re-run of the reported incident: two actors committing to one branch, a
  `:diverged` push, a `head_not_pushed` park, and a hand recovery.

  ## Cost

  One `Issue` read plus in-memory registry lookups. No forge call — callers
  run this as a cheap pre-gate *before* spending a forge request (see
  `PRPatrol.dispatch_candidate?/2`).

  when no task in the workspace authored that PR at all (an outside
  contributor's PR is nobody's branch to protect).

  Never raises, and never fails open: a read failure resolves to `{:gated,
  :undeterminable, nil}`, because a guard that authorises filing-and-pushing
  must not let the action through on a question it could not answer (§5.2,
  class F). The cost is one tick — the next one re-reads and decides.
