defmodule Arbiter.Reviews.ExternalReview do
  @moduledoc """
  Review an **external / non-arbiter PR** — one the fleet never opened (a
  coworker's PR) — with no pre-linked arbiter task and no arbiter-authored
  branch (bd-d4ealy).

  ## Why this exists

  `arb review <task-id>` dispatches a claude-driven reviewer against the PR/MR
  *linked to an arbiter task* — but a task's `pr_ref` is only minted when arbiter
  itself opens/manages the MR. There was no supported path to point a review at
  an existing external PR. This module is that path: given a repo checkout + a
  PR identifier (URL or number), it constructs an `mr_ref` through the
  configured **MR-provider adapter** and runs `Arbiter.Workflows.CodeReview` in
  `:adapter` mode — read the diff, post per-finding inline comments, submit a
  single verdict — entirely against the forge, with no task / worktree / branch.

  ## Tracker vs. MR-provider split

  A workspace may track issues in Jira while its MRs live on GitHub. The review
  targets the **MR provider** (`config["merge"]["strategy"]` →
  `Arbiter.Mergers.for_workspace/1`), *not* the issue tracker. `mr_ref`
  construction is delegated to the adapter's `ref_for_pr/2` callback, so adding
  GitLab / another MR provider needs no change here — the orchestrator stays
  adapter-blind.

  ## Sync vs. async

    * `review/1` runs the whole thing synchronously and returns the verdict —
      used by tests and any caller that wants to block on the result.
    * `dispatch/1` validates synchronously (so a bad PR ref / unsupported
      strategy fails fast with a clear error) and then runs the workflow in a
      supervised background `Task`, returning a "dispatched" ack immediately.
      The findings + verdict land on the PR itself. This mirrors the
      fire-and-acknowledge semantics of `arb review`.

  ## Follow-up engagement (Option A, bd-2ovun1)

  A one-shot external review posts findings + a verdict and then forgets the PR
  — nothing re-reviews new commits, handles author replies, or tracks the PR to
  merge. Those lifecycle behaviours live in `Arbiter.Workflows.ReviewPatrol`,
  which only acts on **engagements**: an `Issue` with `review_only == true` and a
  `source_pr` set.

  So when `follow_up` is set (default: on when the workspace has a ReviewPatrol
  running), this module — **after the verdict posts** — creates exactly one such
  engagement so ReviewPatrol adopts the PR on its next tick. The engagement:

    * is `review_only` and `tracker_type: :none` → tracker-inert (no upstream
      lifecycle write-back) and `issue_type: :task` → the non-reviewable type
      that spawns **no worktree/branch**;
    * records `source_pr` = the constructed `mr_ref` (what ReviewPatrol hands to
      `adapter.get/1`), a baseline `last_reviewed_sha` (PR head at review time,
      so only *later* commits trigger a re-review), a `last_seen_comment_id`
      high-watermark (so only *new* author replies trigger), and the resolved
      `review_automation` mode;
    * carries `tracker_context_ref`/`tracker_context_type` when supplied.

  Dedup: if an open `review_only` engagement already exists for
  `(source_pr, workspace)`, no second one is created — a repeated `follow_up`
  dispatch for the same PR is a no-op on the engagement.
