defmodule Arbiter.Reviews.PrStatePoller do
  @moduledoc """
  Background job that keeps `ExternalReview` records' `pr_state` fresh
  (bd-3jjk0e), independent of any open dashboard.

  Before this, pr_state was resolved *only* lazily while a dashboard LiveView
  was mounted — so a PR that merged/closed while nobody was watching kept a
  stale `open` (or a frozen `unknown`) forever. This singleton GenServer runs on
  a recurring timer, walks the non-terminal records (per
  `Arbiter.Reviews.PrState.needs_refresh?/1`), and re-resolves each one, so the
  dashboard is now a *reader* of pr_state rather than its only writer.

  Terminal states (`merged` / `closed` / `gone` / `n/a`) are skipped, so the
  poll set shrinks to genuinely in-flight PRs. A transient failure leaves a row
  `unknown` and it is retried on a later cycle; a hard 404 lands on the terminal
  `gone` and drops out of the set.

  ## Per-record backoff (bd-7qgxf9)

  "Non-terminal" is a much larger set than "in flight". A long-lived install
  accumulates review records whose PR is simply still `open` — nobody is
  waiting on them and nothing about them is going to change this minute — plus
  rows parked at `unknown` because a token blip failed them once. Re-resolving
  every one of them on every cycle made this poller's cost a function of
  *history*, flat at one call per record per minute forever: ~30 such records
  is the ~1,776 GitHub calls/hour a completely quiet fleet was measured
  burning, roughly a third of the account-wide 5,000/hr budget that GitHub
  meters per *user* rather than per token.

  So each record carries its own cadence instead of sharing one global tick:

    * a check that finds the state **unchanged** doubles that record's personal
      interval — `interval_ms`, 2×, 4×, … up to `:backoff_ceiling_ms`;
    * a check that finds it **changed** resets to `interval_ms`, so a PR that
      is actually moving is followed closely again on the very next cycle;
    * a check that **fails** counts as unchanged, which is what finally puts a
      permanently-`unknown` row on a decaying retry instead of a hot loop.

  A settled record therefore costs ~6 calls in its first hour and one per
  ceiling thereafter, and the cost of an idle installation decays toward zero
  no matter how much history it carries. The cadence lives in this GenServer's
  memory rather than on the row: a restart is worth one full re-sweep (which
  also re-verifies everything after downtime) and then decays again in minutes,
  which is not worth a migration or a DB write per skipped record.

  Cycles are additionally **budgeted** at `:max_checks_per_cycle` records,
  most-overdue first, so a large first sweep after a restart is spread over
  several cycles rather than landing as one spike; ordering by due time means
  no record starves.

  ## Configuration

  Via `config :arbiter, :pr_state_poller`:

    * `:enabled`              — master switch (default `true`; `false` in test,
                                where tests drive `poll/1` synchronously).
    * `:interval_ms`          — cycle interval, and the base of each record's
                                backoff (default 60 000).
    * `:fetch_limit`          — max records scanned per cycle (default 500).
    * `:backoff_ceiling_ms`   — longest a settled record's interval may grow to
                                (default 3 600 000, one hour).
    * `:max_checks_per_cycle` — max records actually re-resolved per cycle
                                (default 25).
