defmodule Arbiter.Reviews.PushState do
  @moduledoc """
  Whether the commit a review (or an escalation) is talking about is actually
  **on the remote branch the PR/MR points at** (bd-2jkrqu).

  ## Why this exists

  Every other part of the review/merge control plane reads the *local*
  worktree: `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate` diffs `base_sha..HEAD` in the worktree,
  the reviewer agent reads files in the worktree, `stamp_reviewed_head/1`
  stamps `git rev-parse HEAD`. That is correct only while local HEAD and
  `origin/<branch>` are the same commit — and nothing enforced that.

  On 2026-09-15 they were not. A ReviewGate fix round committed its fixes as
  `edadf22c` in the worktree and never pushed; `origin` and the MR's pipeline
  stayed on the unfixed `8deed4e5`. The round-2 reviewer read the local
  worktree, marked every finding `[ADDRESSED]` citing lines that existed only
  locally, and APPROVED. The park escalation then told a human "the work is
  committed and the branch is pushed … merge it by hand, if the diff is fine".
  Merging by hand would have merged the unfixed commit. (Two days earlier, a
  timed-out fix round left *sixteen* commits unpushed.)

  This module is the one place that answers the git question underneath all of
  that, so the gate, the coverage/stamp writes and the escalation text all
  answer it the same way instead of assuming.

  ## The three-valued verdict

  `verdict/1` is deliberately three-valued, because "I could not tell" and
  "definitely not pushed" must not be collapsed:

    * `:pushed` — local HEAD is an ancestor of (or equal to) `origin/<branch>`;
      the remote genuinely carries this commit.
    * `:unpushed` — the remote ref exists and does **not** contain local HEAD,
      or the branch does not exist on the remote at all. Positive knowledge of
      the bug's shape.
    * `:unknown` — no worktree, no `origin`, or git failed. Callers **fail
      open** here: an ad-hoc checkout with no remote is not an incident, and a
      guard that refuses on "I could not tell" is exactly the misfire class
      `docs/review-coverage-and-guard-policy.md` §5.1 exists to prevent.

  `:behind` counts as `:pushed` on purpose: the remote already has this commit
  (and more). The head under review is published; whether the branch also
  moved on is a different question, and not this guard's.

  ## The worktree must be ON the branch

  Every answer here is derived from the worktree's `git rev-parse HEAD` — the
  commit that is *checked out*, which is only the branch's head while the
  worktree is on that branch. Some ad-hoc runs and test rigs reuse a repo as
  the worktree with HEAD on `main` and a `branch:` that lives elsewhere (the
  shape `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate.prepare_branch_for_review/1` and
  `reviewer_commit_check/1` already guard for). Comparing `main`'s tip against
  `origin/<branch>` answers a question nobody asked, and `ensure_pushed/3`
  would then push `main`'s tip onto the PR branch — a merge-safety guard
  writing the wrong commit to the remote it is protecting.

  So the branch check is a precondition of the module, not of its callers: a
  worktree that is not on `branch` (including a detached HEAD) is
  `:not_on_branch` → `:unknown`, and every caller fails open on it.

  ## Fetching

  `inspect_branch/3` fetches `origin/<branch>` first by default, because a
  stale remote-tracking ref would answer the question about the past. Pass
  `fetch?: false` on a path that has just fetched or pushed (the tracking ref
  is updated by a successful push) to skip the network round trip.
