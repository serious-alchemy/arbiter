defmodule Arbiter.Reviews.GuardRegistry do
  @moduledoc """
  One declared row per review/merge guard. Declarative only — nothing here runs
  at request time (P8 of `docs/review-coverage-and-guard-policy.md`, design
  #1635 §5.4).

  ## Why this exists

  The investigation behind #1635 found the same failure shape sixteen times: a
  guard was added to stop an incident, the guard misfired, and the misfire cost
  more than the incident (`$325.82` across chain A alone). §5.1 states the
  policy as four invariants — every refusal has a finite bound (I1), a guard
  never strands approved work as a failed run (I2), one escalation per episode
  (I3), and:

  > **I4 — A guard that is not in the registry does not exist.**

  This module is that registry. It is modelled on
  `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate`'s `@verdict_guards` list, which already proves the
  pattern works for four guards: one table, one row per guard, and a test that
  raises rather than defaulting when a name is missing.

  A row is a *declaration*, not a mechanism: it records what the guard's bound,
  episode key and terminal state **are today**, so the two tests in
  `test/arbiter/reviews/guard_registry_test.exs` can hold the line.

  ## Row fields

    * `:id` — the registry's own name for the guard.
    * `:doc_ref` — the §2 inventory id (`"G1"`, `"W7"`, `"M3"`, …). Every one of
      §2's 60 rows appears here exactly once.
    * `:class` — `:a`–`:f`, per §5.3. `:class_source` is `:doc` when §5.3 names
      the guard explicitly and `:inferred` when it does not; every `:inferred`
      row carries a `:class_note` giving the reasoning.
    * `:bound` — `{unit, n}` with `n` a positive integer, or `{unit, {:config,
      name}}` when the bound is a module attribute / resolver function (`name`
      must then also appear in `:anchors`). `{unit, :unbounded}` records a guard
      that has **no** bound today; it is a policy violation and may only appear
      on a row listed in `known_violations/0`.
    * `:episode` — I3's reset condition, as a tuple of the keys the escalation is
      deduped on. `R5`'s atomic claim is the reference implementation.
    * `:terminal` — where the guard leaves the work once its bound is spent:

          :proceeds     fails open — the work continues in its last good state
          :skipped      this tick is skipped; the next one re-evaluates
          :parked       parked and still watched; no further action issued
          :escalated_once  one page, then no further action
          :resumed      fails the run only to hand it to auto-resume
          :frozen       blocked until a human or config change
          :given_up     terminal refusal, recorded as such
          :failed_run   converts a guard *misfire* into `Run.status = :failed`
                        — an I2 violation; must be in `known_violations/0`
          :failed_run_by_design
                        fails the run because the work genuinely did not happen
                        (nothing was committed); requires a `:policy_note`
          :retries_forever
                        re-issues its action with no terminal state — an I1
                        violation; must be in `known_violations/0`

    * `:sites` — `{module, function, arity}` for the code the row governs. Every
      site must still exist; a row pointing at a deleted function fails the
      suite.
    * `:anchors` — source substrings (attribute names, reason atoms) that must
      still appear in the site module. This is how a bound stays anchored
      without a line number.

  ## How completeness is enforced

  The mechanism is an **AST scan**, `Arbiter.Test.GuardRefusalScan` — not an
  `@guard` attribute on each guard function. An attribute only fails the suite
  when someone adds the attribute and forgets the row, which is the easy half of
  the mistake; the scan fails when someone adds a refusal path *at all*. It
  reads the source of every module in `control_plane/0` and reports the function
  each refusal originates in, using three syntactic signals (refusal-shaped
  function name, a call to a refusal primitive such as `Worker.fail/2` or
  `CoordinatorNotifier.*`, and a returned `{:error, {tag, …}}` tuple — see that
  module's docs for the exact rules and their two deliberate exclusions).

  The test then requires every detected site to be **accounted for**: either it
  is some row's `:site`, or it is listed in the test's own
  `@non_guard_sites` table with a reason. Both halves are asserted to be free of
  stale entries, so neither list can rot. Adding an escalation or a
  `Worker.fail/2` anywhere in the six modules therefore fails
  `guard_registry_test.exs` until it is declared.

  ## Known violations

  `known_violations/0` records the rows that **violate the policy today**, with
  their current behaviour and the phase that removes them. P8 does not fix
  them — recording them is the point, because an exemption list that is
  enumerated, tested and only allowed to shrink is a schedule, whereas an
  unwritten one is the status quo. The test freezes the id set: an entry may be
  removed, never added.
