defmodule Arbiter.ReviewGate.Round do
  @moduledoc """
  A durable, structured outcome for a single `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate` pass
  (bd-aqyjuc / #1011 gap G2).

  Before this resource existed, a ReviewGate round's outcome survived nowhere
  but reviewer transcript prose (a `VERDICT: APPROVE`/`REQUEST_CHANGES` line
  buried in a 1,000+ line run) and the authoring run's terminal
  `failure_reason` — which only distinguishes the FINAL round from all others,
  and only on failure. A task rejected in round 1 and approved in round 2
  recorded as `main | completed | failure_reason NULL`; the round-1 rejection
  was invisible without an LLM re-reading the transcript.

  One row is inserted per reviewer pass (when its verdict is parsed) and per
  implementer pass (when its revise response is captured) — at the point
  `Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGate` already holds everything in hand, so the write
  is a pure side effect with no additional parsing. Rows for malformed/no-verdict
  passes (re-prompted, retried) are deliberately NOT written — only a pass that
  reaches a genuine, actionable outcome (an APPROVE, a REQUEST_CHANGES with real
  findings, or a completed implementer revision) gets a row.

  ## Fields

    * `task_id`        — the task under review (never carries the `#review`/
                          `#implN` synthetic suffixes ReviewGate uses internally
                          for its own worker ids).
    * `run_id`         — best-effort FK to the `Arbiter.Workers.Run` row for
                          this specific pass (the synthetic reviewer/implementer
                          worker, not the author's run). Nil if it couldn't be
                          resolved.
    * `round`          — 1-indexed revise-and-rediscuss round this pass belongs
                          to, WITHIN its own `fix_round_attempt`. An automatic
                          fix round (bd-a9zb7w) restarts a fresh ReviewGate that
                          begins again at round 1, so `round` alone is not
                          unique per task — see `fix_round_attempt`.
    * `fix_round_attempt`
                        — bd-6d3h8m: 0 for the original ReviewGate pass, N for
                          the Nth automatic implementer fix round
                          (`Arbiter.Worker.maybe_dispatch_fix_round/3`) that
                          re-attached a fresh ReviewGate. `(fix_round_attempt,
                          round)` together are unique per task/role/verdict
                          pass; `review_gate_rounds_list` sorts on both so a
                          task that went through a fix round reads as two
                          consecutive passes instead of two interleaved
                          round-1..3 sequences.
    * `role`           — `:review` (a reviewer pass) or `:impl` (an implementer
                          revise pass).
    * `verdict`        — `:approve`, `:request_changes` or `:timed_out` for a
                          `:review` row; always nil for `:impl` (implementers
                          don't issue verdicts). `:timed_out` (bd-216r3e) is a
                          pass that exhausted its budget without producing a
                          verdict — an infrastructure failure, recorded with
                          `finding_count: 0` because no reviewer said anything.
                          It used to be written as a `:request_changes` row
                          carrying a single synthetic "the gate timed out"
                          finding, which re-dispatched an implementer that had
                          nothing to fix, which timed out again.
    * `findings`        — the reviewer's findings text (from the `VERDICT:` line
                          onward) for a `:review` row, or the implementer's raw
                          revise-response transcript for an `:impl` row.
    * `finding_count`   — best-effort count of enumerated findings (list-item
                          lines) in `findings`. Nil for `:impl` rows.
    * `reviewer_model`  — the model that ran this pass (reviewer or implementer,
                          despite the field name — matches the ticket's requested
                          shape). Nil when not captured (e.g. a stub fixture in
                          tests, which never emits a `result` event).
    * `reviewer_tier`   — the abstract `model_tier` (`"economy"` | `"standard"`
                          | `"premium"`) resolved for a `:review` row (bd-3xultf:
                          the reviewer's tier is the task's own tier bumped one
                          step). Always nil for `:impl` rows. Recorded alongside
                          `reviewer_model` so convergence analysis can segment by
                          the judge's tier instead of a moving reviewer reading
                          as a quality change.
    * `reviewer_provider`
                        — bd-3hb4ih: which agent provider ran a `:review` pass
                          (`"claude"` / `"gemini"` / `"codex"`). Always nil for
                          `:impl` rows and for a pass that never reached a
                          provider (a pre-review escalation). Needed once a
                          reviewer print-timeout rotates to the next entry in a
                          `review_agent.type` pool: the rotation writes a
                          `:timed_out` row per provider that timed out, and the
                          verdict row names the provider that finally produced
                          it — a question `reviewer_model` cannot answer,
                          because a timed-out pass usually has no usage row and
                          therefore no model.
    * `reviewer_family` / `implementer_family`
                        — bd-a1ke2c: under `review_agent.cross_family`, the model
                          family (`Arbiter.Agents.ModelFamily`) that ran a
                          `:review` pass and the implementer family it had to
                          differ from. Nil when cross-family review is off.
    * `same_family_fallback` / `same_family_fallback_reason`
                        — true, with which families were unavailable and why,
                          when no other family could review and the pass ran in
                          the implementer's own family. False on an ordinary
                          cross-family pass; nil when cross-family review is off.
    * `cost_usd`        — USD cost of this pass. Nil when not captured.
    * `criteria_total`  — number of acceptance criteria the reviewer addressed
                          in its per-criterion CRITERIA breakdown (bd-4yhv4x).
                          Nil when the pass carried no breakdown (an `:impl` row,
                          or a `:review` row on a task with no stated criteria).
    * `criteria_unmet`  — how many of those the breakdown marked `[NOT MET]`.
                          Nil alongside a nil `criteria_total`; makes "APPROVE
                          with N criteria unmet" queryable without re-reading
                          the reviewer transcript.
    * `finding_ids`     — JSON array of the `F<round>.<n>` ids this `:review` round
                          raised (bd-6r8caj). Nil for `:impl` rows and for a round
                          that raised none. Gives a finding an identity that
                          survives the round boundary, so round N+1 can be asked
                          "was F1.1 addressed?" — a question free prose could not
                          answer.
    * `dispositions`    — JSON object mapping every finding carried INTO this
                          `:review` round to what the round said about it:
                          `"addressed"` / `"not_addressed"` / `"obsolete"`, or
                          `"none"` when the round never mentioned it. Nil when
                          nothing was carried in (round 1) or for `:impl` rows.
    * `undispositioned_count`
                        — how many Medium-or-higher carried findings the round
                          left with no disposition. A `:review` APPROVE row with
                          a non-zero count IS the bd-8mtb0q defect, queryable
                          without re-reading the reviewer transcript.
    * `converged`       — true for a `:review` row whose verdict is `:approve`
                          AND whose CRITERIA breakdown left no criterion unmet;
                          false otherwise (including all `:impl` rows, and an
                          APPROVE that admits an unmet criterion).
    * `commit_gate`     — bd-2eyf9y: which commit-gate outcome an `:impl` row
                          hit, if any. `:reprompted` — the round ended with
                          HEAD unchanged and a dirty worktree, so the
                          implementer was resumed once to commit instead of
                          dispatching a re-review of the same diff.
                          `:escalated_uncommitted` — still dirty after that
                          resume; escalated instead of re-prompting again.
                          `:escalated_no_changes` — HEAD unchanged and the
                          worktree was clean (no code change at all);
                          escalated instead of re-reviewing an identical diff.
                          `:advanced_non_file_fix` — bd-cb7wpq: HEAD unchanged,
                          worktree clean, but the implementer explicitly
                          declared every finding resolved through something
                          other than a file change (see
                          `non_file_fix_declared?/1`) — dispatched to the next
                          reviewer, which re-checks the live PR for real,
                          instead of escalating a worker that did nothing.
                          `:escalated_no_changes_after_non_file_fix` — the
                          SAME thing happened twice in a row with nothing to
                          show for either: escalated, with a park reason that
                          reads as "resolved out of band, still stalled" rather
                          than a generic idle-worker no-changes failure.
                          Nil for a round whose HEAD advanced normally, for a
                          round with no worktree to check, and for every
                          `:review` row.

  ## Metric start date

  Backfill is out of scope (bd-aqyjuc acceptance). Rows only exist for
  ReviewGate runs from 2026-07-28 onward — treat any convergence-rate or
  finding-category query as reflecting that window, not the system's full
  history.

  ## Retention

  Kept indefinitely, like `Arbiter.Reviews.Record`. No automatic purge.
