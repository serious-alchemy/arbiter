defmodule Arbiter.Agents.AuthHold do
  @moduledoc """
  The auth-shaped dispatch hold (bd-21bmdh): N consecutive `:auth_expired`
  worker deaths on one provider refuse every further dispatch for that
  provider until a recovery signal or an operator clears it.

  ## Why a count, not the first death

  bd-2jgs2h retired the per-dispatch live auth probe, so a worker dying at
  spawn is now the normal way the fleet learns a credential is bad. And a
  worker that dies with `:auth_expired` returns its task to Ready
  (`Arbiter.Worker.AuthDeath`) instead of stranding it `:active`. Those
  two together make a single auth death a *retry*: the task goes back in the
  queue, and the next dispatch either works (a blip) or dies too. The second
  death is the evidence the credential really is dead — so that is where the
  hold opens (`:threshold`, default 2). Without the hold, reopening would
  feed the wave: every death would put its task straight back in the queue.

  "Consecutive" is per provider: a worker that *completes* on the provider
  (`record_success/2`) resets the streak, because it just proved the
  credential works.

  ## What an open hold does

    * `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch`'s auth guard refuses any agent dispatch for
      the provider before the task transitions, before a worktree is
      provisioned and before a worker registers — `open?/2`.
    * `Arbiter.Board.Snapshot.quota_hold/1` shows it as the board-wide hold
      for a workspace whose default provider is held, so
      `Arbiter.Board.Autopilot` does not even attempt the dispatch — `held/2`.
    * Opening it marks `Arbiter.Agents.CredentialWatchdog` expired for the
      provider (`mark_expired/3`), which escalates once to every workspace's
      coordinator, reports `credentials_expired` on the quota surfaces, and
      switches the watchdog to its fast recovery poll.

  ## Fail-closed

  `open?/2` — the dispatch guard's read — answers `true` when the hold
  cannot be read at all (process down, call timed out). Every handler here is
  a map update, so a timeout is a genuine fault, and refusing a dispatch for
  one Autopilot tick is recoverable; a wave of 401ing spawns is the thing
  this exists to stop. `held/2`, the board's *display* read, fails open
  (`nil`) instead: the guard is the backstop, and the board must not paint a
  hold that is not there.

  Only a positive signal closes an open hold. A worker completing while it is
  open does not (it may have started before the credential died), and time
  passing does not.

  ## Reset paths

    1. **The watchdog's recovery signal.** `CredentialWatchdog` calls
       `recovered/2` whenever an expired adapter recovers: its own periodic
       probe passing, or `mark_recovered/2` from
       `Arbiter.Quota.CloudProbe` — the free usage-poll check passing
       (Claude's `/api/oauth/usage`, Codex's usage GET, agy's `/usage`).
       CloudProbe sends it on a passing check whenever this hold is open, not
       only after its own 401 streak.
    2. **An operator.** `breaker_reset` with `provider` (MCP),
       `POST /api/breakers/reset` with `provider`, or
       `arb breaker reset --auth-hold <provider>` → `reset/2`. Clears the
       streak and, unconditionally (bd-3kg53c), any `CredentialWatchdog` mark
       for the adapter — even one this hold never opened, e.g. a
       `:periodic_probe` expiry with no worker having died on it. Without
       that, an operator reaching for the one documented lever for a stuck
       `CredentialWatchdog` entry got a silent no-op whenever this hold
       happened not to be the thing that raised it. `breaker_list` /
       `arb breaker list` show every hold and live streak under `auth_holds`,
       and every outstanding watchdog mark (open hold or not) under
       `credential_watchdog`.

  An automatic recovery leaves the provider on **probation**: the next auth
  death re-opens the hold at once instead of after another N. The free checks
  read the operator's host credentials, which are not always the ones a
  worker spawns with (a per-workspace token, a provider account), so "the
  free check passes" and "workers still die" can both be true. Probation
  bounds that case to one death per recovery signal rather than N; a worker
  completing on the provider ends probation. An operator reset is a full
  reset — no probation.

  ## State is in-memory

  Like `CredentialWatchdog` and `Arbiter.CircuitBreaker`, a restart clears
  every hold. The worst case is N more fast auth deaths before it re-opens
  (and the free checks re-mark the watchdog within two poll cycles). Each
  task additionally carries its own bound — `Arbiter.Worker.AuthDeath` stops
  reopening a task after `:max_task_reopens` auth deaths — so no restart
  pattern can cycle one task forever.

  ## Configuration

      config :arbiter, :auth_hold,
        threshold: 2,          # consecutive auth deaths that open the hold
        max_task_reopens: 3    # auth deaths after which a task is no longer reopened

  Explicit `start_link/1` opts outrank app env for `:threshold` (tests).
