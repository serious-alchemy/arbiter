defmodule Arbiter.Agents.SecurityPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  The normalized, **provider-agnostic** security posture for a worker run.

  A worker (implementer or reviewer) is an autonomous coding agent spawned in a
  git worktree. Left unconfigured it silently inherits the host operator's
  global agent config — on the Claude provider that means the operator's
  personal `~/.claude/settings.json` (historically `defaultMode: auto`, an
  **empty deny list**) and an **un-sandboxed** run with full filesystem and
  network reach. A wedged live server traced to exactly that posture
  (2026-06-03) is what this module exists to prevent.

  This struct is the single normalized shape every provider adapter maps to
  its own mechanism. It names *intent* ("auto mode, deny destructive ops,
  scope the filesystem to the worktree"), never provider syntax. The Claude
  adapter (`Arbiter.Agents.Claude.Security`) translates it into
  `--permission-mode` / `--settings` / `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; a
  future adapter (antigravity, Codex, …) maps the *same* struct to its own
  flags. See `docs/worker-security.md` and the harness design
  (`docs/agent-harness-design.md`, bd-c6xf18).

  ## Shape

      %Arbiter.Agents.SecurityPolicy{
        permissions: %{
          mode: :auto | :strict | :bypass,
          allow: [String.t()],          # operator-added allow rules (adapter-interpreted)
          deny:  [String.t()],          # operator-added deny rules (adapter-interpreted)
          safe_defaults: [atom()],      # resolved: safe_default_categories() -- safe_defaults_exclude
          safe_defaults_exclude: [atom()] # categories explicitly dropped by name
        },
        sandbox: %{
          enabled: boolean(),
          filesystem: :worktree | :none,
          network: boolean(),
          writable_paths: [String.t()]  # extra paths writable inside the OS jail
        }
      }

  ### `permissions.mode`

    * `:bypass` — the headless-safe default. The interactive permission
      classifier is skipped entirely (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) so
      there is no approval prompt that can freeze a headless worker.
      The **deny list is still enforced** via `--settings` — the deny list is
      a hard block at the tool level, orthogonal to the interactive classifier.
      This is the right default for autonomous, headless worker runs where
      worktree containment + the deny list are the real fence.
    * `:auto`   — opt-in for interactive/supervised runs. The permission
      classifier is active (`--permission-mode auto`): edits are auto-accepted
      but the classifier can pause and ask for approval. The deny list is also
      enforced. **Do not use as the worker default**: in headless `--print`
      mode, a classifier prompt that can't be answered freezes the run
      silently.
    * `:strict` — only explicitly allowed tools run; anything not on the
      allow-list is blocked (in non-interactive `--print` mode "ask" collapses
      to "deny"). Deny still enforced.

  ### `permissions.safe_defaults`

  The baseline destructive-operation categories every adapter must deny — the
  "non-empty deny even in `auto`" guarantee. Each adapter expands a category
  into its own concrete rules. Categories:

    * `:no_destructive_fs`  — recursive force-deletes (`rm -rf`, …).
    * `:no_force_push`      — `git push --force` / `-f`.
    * `:no_secret_reads`    — reading `.env`, private keys, `~/.ssh`, cloud creds.
    * `:no_outside_writes`  — writing to sensitive paths outside the worktree.
    * `:no_pr_create`       — opening a PR/MR from the worker (`gh pr create`,
      `glab mr create`). The MergeQueue owns PR creation; a worker that opens its
      own PR produces a duplicate on the wrong base (bd-53xrmi).
    * `:no_async_wait`      — `Monitor` / `ScheduleWakeup`. These tools yield a
      turn and resume it when a later event fires, which only works in an
      interactive session. `claude --print` ends the whole process the instant
      a turn produces no tool call, so a worker that arms one ends its turn
      "waiting" and is never woken — the notification has nowhere to arrive
      (bd-d534xo). Denying the tools outright backs the prompt guidance that
      says the same thing.
    * `:no_public_upload`   — network access to public, anonymous file and
      paste hosts (`public_upload_hosts/0`). An agy worker uploaded mockup
      "screenshots" to files.catbox.moe to satisfy an acceptance criterion it
      could not meet (bd-80talz). Such a host takes repo content, logs or
      secrets just as easily, anonymously and usually for good.
    * `:no_gh_publish`      — `gh gist create`/`edit` and `gh issue comment`.
      The same worker made a public gist on the operator's account and posted
      a test comment (bd-80talz). `gh pr comment` is left alone because the
      review-thread follow-up protocol uses it. Workers only:
      `interactive_session_base/0` leaves it out, since an operator or
      coordinator session commenting on an issue is ordinary work.

  Enforced in **every** mode including `:bypass`: `Arbiter.Agents.Claude.Security`
  expands them into the deny document, and `--settings` carries that document
  even when `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is passed. What `:bypass` skips is
  the interactive classifier, not the deny list.

  ### `permissions.safe_defaults_exclude` (bd-4420va)

  The **only** supported way to drop a category from `safe_default_categories/0`
  by name. Each layer's exclude list **unions** onto the previous (like
  `allow`/`deny`) — once a layer excludes a category it stays excluded unless
  a later config edit removes it from the exclude list. The resolved
  `permissions.safe_defaults` is always `safe_default_categories() --
  safe_defaults_exclude`.

  The legacy `permissions.safe_defaults` config key (a literal, replacing
  list) is still read without error, but is **inert**: it no longer narrows
  the resolved set. It used to — a workspace that pinned a subset (say, the 4
  categories that existed before v0.1.78 added 4 more) silently never
  resolved a category added after it pinned, with nothing surfacing the gap
  (vstim missed `:no_public_upload`, `:no_pr_create`, `:no_async_wait` and
  `:no_gh_publish` this way). No manual migration is required: an old pinned
  `safe_defaults` list keeps parsing, it just no longer excludes anything —
  every current default category applies unless separately named in
  `safe_defaults_exclude`. `arb server doctor` / `arb prime` name any category
  a workspace's resolved policy excludes (`SecurityPolicy.summary/1`'s
  `"safe_defaults_exclude"` key), so an exclusion is always visible rather
  than silent.

  ### `sandbox`

  Normalized isolation intent. `filesystem: :worktree` keeps file access
  scoped to the worktree the agent was handed; `network: false` cuts the
  agent's network-egress tools. Adapters enforce this with whatever their
  provider supports — for Claude that is permission rules + directory scoping
  (a permission-level guard, *not* a kernel jail; full OS isolation is a
  documented follow-up). The field is also surfaced verbatim so the operator
  can see the declared posture.

  `writable_paths` (bd-5gvqgc) only matters where a worker runs inside the
  OS write jail (`Arbiter.Worker.Jail`, agy under `:strict` today): each entry
  (absolute, or `~/…`) is bound writable on top of the otherwise read-only
  filesystem. It is the operator's escape hatch for a toolchain cache the
  per-worker `HEX_HOME`/`MIX_HOME`/`XDG_CACHE_HOME` do not cover. Every
  writable shared path is also a way for a jailed worker to leave something
  behind that runs later outside the jail (a shared `~/.mix/archives` runs in
  the operator's own mix commands), so keep the list short. It **unions**
  across layers like `allow`/`deny`.

  ## Resolution

  `resolve/3` layers, lowest precedence first:

    1. `base/0` — the hardcoded safe baseline (this module).
    2. `Application.get_env(:arbiter, :worker_security_policy)` — the
       install-wide default override.
    3. **`workspace.config["agent"]["security"]` — the CANONICAL per-domain
       (workspace-wide) posture.** This is the documented, stable config path.
       The `permissions.mode` value is read from
       `workspace.config["agent"]["security"]["permissions"]["mode"]`.
       (Legacy paths `workspace.config["security"]["mode"]` and
       `workspace.config["agent"]["config"]["security_mode"]` are accepted for
       backward compatibility but are deprecated; new configs must use the
       canonical path.)
    4. `workspace.config["agent"]["security"]["repos"][repo]` — a per-repo
       override *within* the domain, applied only when a `repo` name is passed.
       This lets a multi-repo workspace run one repo under a different posture
       (e.g. a stricter `mode`, an extra deny rule, or `sandbox.network: false`)
       without touching the others. The `"repos"` key is inert for `merge/2`
       (which reads only `permissions`/`sandbox`), so a workspace that never
       sets it — the common case — resolves exactly as before.
    5. an explicit per-dispatch / per-task `override` map.

  For `permissions.allow` / `permissions.deny` / `permissions.safe_defaults_exclude`
  / `sandbox.writable_paths` each layer **unions** onto the previous (a domain adds to the baseline
  rather than dropping it) — so a repo override *adds* allow/deny rules, or
  further exclusions, on top of the workspace posture. `mode` and every
  other `sandbox` field are **replaced** by the highest layer that sets them. The
  legacy `permissions.safe_defaults` key is inert (see above) — it is parsed
  but never changes the resolved set. Unknown / malformed values are ignored
  (the codebase reads JSON config leniently), so a typo degrades to the safer
  inherited value rather than raising.

  The baseline for an **interactive coordinator session** — a real TUI on a
  real PTY with a human at the keyboard (`Arbiter.Sessions`), not a headless
  `claude --print` worker.

  Two things separate it from `base/0`, and both follow from that one
  difference (bd-5xlkkj):

    * `mode: :auto` rather than `:bypass`. `:bypass` exists because a headless
      run freezes on a permission prompt nobody can answer; a session *has*
      somebody to answer, so the classifier is a working guard rather than a
      hang, and running it also spares the operator the "WARNING: Claude Code
      running in Bypass Permissions mode" acceptance screen on every first
      launch.
    * `:no_async_wait` is dropped. `Monitor` and `ScheduleWakeup` are denied to
      workers because `--print` ends the process the instant a turn produces no
      tool call, so a wakeup has no session left to arrive in (bd-d534xo). In a
      session the turn *is* interactive and the wakeup does arrive — `Monitor`
      is how a coordinator session watches the `/events` stream
      (`docs/monitoring.md`).

  Everything else is deliberately unchanged: the destructive-fs, force-push,
  secret-read and outside-write denies all apply, and so does `:no_pr_create`
  (the MergeQueue still owns PR creation — bd-53xrmi — and a hand-rolled
  `gh pr create` from a coordinator console produces the same duplicate on the
  same wrong base).

  It also denies `Bash(arb mcp token mint:*)` (bd-5b5hq7). A session's own MCP
  token is already deliberately weaker than a full coordinator token —
  `can_dispatch: false` by default, possibly workspace-bound, and revoked when
  the session ends. The rule stops the session from even trying to trade up
  for a full-power token by running the CLI. The server-side boundaries are
  `ArbiterWeb.Api.McpController.mint_token/2`, which caps a bearer caller at
  its own authority and refuses anonymous callers outright, and
  `Arbiter.MCP.OperatorSocket`, which refuses any process the server spawned
  and any process inside a session's `arb-session-<id>` scope (bd-8381tk).
