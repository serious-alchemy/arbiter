  Whether this host's Gemini-family spawn actually enforces the resolved
  `Arbiter.Agents.SecurityPolicy` (bd-7s29yq / T6b).

  True only when **both** halves of the seam are present:

    * the CLI on `PATH` is `agy` — the upstream `gemini` CLI has no analogue of
      `permissions.allow/deny` and still runs with whatever posture it
      inherits, so it answers `false`; and
    * worker config isolation is on (`Arbiter.Agents.Gemini.ConfigDir.enabled?/0`)
      — agy reads its posture only from `$HOME/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`,
      so without an Arbiter-owned `$HOME` there is nowhere to put the generated
      document and the spawn silently inherits the operator's
      `always-proceed`-with-no-deny-list file. That is precisely the state
      bd-7s29yq found, and the REST posture surface must keep showing it as
      *not* enforced.

  When both hold, `permissions.deny` is a hard block in every mode — confirmed
  live, including under `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; see
  `Arbiter.Agents.Gemini.Security`'s moduledoc for the probe results and for
  the two things agy does *not* enforce.
