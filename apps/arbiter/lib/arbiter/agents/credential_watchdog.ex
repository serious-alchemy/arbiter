defmodule Arbiter.Agents.CredentialWatchdog do
  @moduledoc """
  Fleet-level credential liveness monitor (bd-5wchp1).

  Runs as a singleton named GenServer and periodically probes each configured
  agent adapter via `Arbiter.Agents.Preflight.check/2`. When a probe returns
  `:auth_expired` the Watchdog:

    1. Records the adapter as credential-expired in its own state.
    2. Escalates to the coordinator across every active workspace so the operator
       is notified before any worker has to fail first.

  The stored state feeds two guards:

    * **Dispatch guard** — `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch` calls `expired?/1` before
      dispatching a real worker. A known-expired adapter is refused immediately
      without re-running the probe, preventing a wave of identical 401 failures.
    * **Auth hold** — a worker dying with `:auth_expired` no longer marks this
      module directly. It feeds `Arbiter.Agents.AuthHold`'s per-provider streak
      (bd-21bmdh), and the hold calls `mark_expired/3` once N consecutive deaths
      open it — a single death is now a retry, not a fleet-wide refusal. In
      return, every recovery here (a passing periodic probe, or
      `mark_recovered/2`) is forwarded to `AuthHold.recovered/2`, which is what
      clears an open hold automatically.
    * **Usage-poll mark** — `Arbiter.Quota.CloudProbe` also calls `mark_expired/3`
      for Claude after N consecutive `{:http_error, 401}` responses from the
      `/api/oauth/usage` poll (bd-1pmf9h, default N=2). This is a second,
      independent expiry signal alongside the periodic CLI probe above — the
      original incident this closes went undetected for ~15h because the CLI
      probe never saw trouble until the credentials file was removed outright,
      while the usage poll had been 401ing (and, in between, hitting the
      endpoint's own tight rate-limit bucket) the whole time.

  A successful probe on a previously-expired adapter clears the expired flag
  and schedules the next poll at the normal interval. While an adapter is
  known-expired the Watchdog polls at the shorter `:recovery_interval_ms` so it
  detects credential restoration promptly.

  ## This is the only live probe left (bd-2jgs2h)

  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch` used to run its own live CLI probe on every
  dispatch and resume (`Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.run_preflight/2`, via
  `Arbiter.Agents.Preflight.check/2`) — ~760 billed probes/day fleet-wide
  against 10 auth failures in 90 days, half of them mid-run and thus
  unreachable by any pre-flight check anyway. That probe was retired
  2026-09-18; `Dispatch`'s guard is now a free call to `expired?/1` on this
  module's held state, never a live CLI call. See `docs/quota-and-auth.md`
  for the full evidence and posture.

  That makes this module's own periodic probe (below) the *only* live probe
  left anywhere in the fleet, and an entirely optional one: the dispatch
  guard, `mark_expired/2` (from `AuthHold`, after N dying workers) and `mark_recovered/2` (from
  the usage-poll signal) all keep working off held state with **no probing at
  all**. Setting `:adapters` to `[]` — as already done for `gemini` here,
  cutting it from ~180 probes/day to 26 — is a supported, intentional
  low-cost posture, not a gap to route around. See "Configuration" below for
  what you give up by doing so (organic detection + auto-recovery for
  adapters nothing else watches).

  ## Configuration

  Resolution order for `:adapters`, `:interval_ms` and `:recovery_interval_ms`
  (highest wins):

    1. explicit `start_link/1` opts (used by tests and embedded callers),
    2. `Arbiter.Settings` — the runtime-settable install-wide singleton
       (`credential_watchdog_adapters`, `credential_watchdog_interval_ms`,
       `credential_watchdog_recovery_interval_ms`), writable over MCP via
       `installation_config_set`,
    3. `config :arbiter, :credential_watchdog`,
    4. the hardcoded defaults below.

  These three are **re-resolved at the top of every poll cycle**, not frozen
  into GenServer state at `init/1` — mirroring how `Arbiter.Board.Snapshot`
  consults `Arbiter.Settings.conductor_system_max_concurrent/0` inline. So
  dropping an adapter from the probe list (e.g. `codex`, whose probe is a real
  billed round-trip against the ChatGPT backend) takes effect on the next tick
  with no restart. The per-adapter *expiry* map is ordinary GenServer state and
  keeps persisting across polls as before.

  One consequence worth knowing: an adapter that is already marked expired and
  is then removed from the probe list keeps that mark (nothing probes it, so
  nothing can clear it) and stays refused by the dispatch guard. `mark_expired/3`
  likewise still records adapters outside the probe list. Use `reset/1` to clear.

  Settings:

    * `:interval_ms`          — normal probe interval (default 5 minutes).
    * `:recovery_interval_ms` — re-probe interval while expired (default 1 min).
    * `:adapters`             — adapters to probe. Adapter modules (opts / app
                                env) or agent-type name strings (`Arbiter.Settings`).
                                Unset probes all of `Arbiter.Agents.adapters/0`;
                                `[]` probes nothing.
    * `:enabled`              — set to `false` to disable all probing (default
                                `true`; set to `false` in the test config so the
                                suite never calls the real agent CLI). Read once
                                at `init/1` — unlike the three above, changing it
                                does require a restart.
