defmodule Arbiter.Agents.Preflight do
  @moduledoc """
  Cheap, provider-agnostic auth probe for the agent CLI (bd-awi4nw).

  The confirmed failure mode: the operator's Claude OAuth (or Gemini key)
  expires, every worker spawn 401s, and the fleet burns cycles dispatching a
  wave of workers that all fail with a buried generic error. The original fix
  was to probe *before every dispatch*; bd-2jgs2h retired that, because a
  billed model turn per dispatch and per resume (~760/day fleet-wide) bought
  nothing a fast-failing spawn does not (see `docs/quota-and-auth.md`).

  **Who calls this now:** `Arbiter.Agents.CredentialWatchdog`'s periodic
  liveness poll, for the adapters in its `:adapters` setting, and nothing else.
  `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch` reads the Watchdog's *state* (`expired?/1`) — a
  free lookup — and never spawns a probe. So a probe's verdict no longer gates
  an individual dispatch; it moves an adapter's expiry flag, and *that* bounds
  the fleet.

  This module owns the **probe execution**: it spawns the adapter's probe argv
  through an Erlang `Port` (the same liveness-first mechanism the worker uses
  for real workers), captures output + exit status under a timeout, and hands
  the result to `Arbiter.Worker.StopReason` for classification. The adapter
  supplies *what* to run via the optional `auth_probe_argv/1` callback; an
  adapter that doesn't implement it is unprobeable and `check/2` returns
  `:skipped` (we never block on an absent probe).

  ## Result

    * `:ok` — the probe authenticated and exited cleanly.
    * `{:error, %StopReason{}}` — the probe failed; the reason carries the
      classified cause (`:auth_expired`, `:credit_exhausted`, …) + remediation.
    * `{:warn, %StopReason{}}` — the probe outran its watchdog. Advisory: the
      caller should log it and **proceed**. See the decision below.
    * `:skipped` — the adapter exposes no probe, so there's nothing to check.

  ## Decision: a pre-flight timeout fails open (bd-svczq4)

  A timeout is the one probe outcome that says nothing about the credentials.
  `arb dispatch … --provider gemini` was refused on 2026-09-18 with "agent
  produced no output within the watchdog window (possible hang)" for a probe
  that had authenticated fine and made 21 model calls — it had simply taken
  102s against a hard-coded 30s watchdog, and two earlier probes the same day
  finished in 16s. When the *probe's own* reliability is the variable, a
  blocking verdict is a coin flip on valid work.

  So: **a timeout fails open**. `check/2` returns `{:warn, reason}`, distinct
  from `{:error, reason}`, and no caller may treat it as evidence about the
  credentials: the `CredentialWatchdog` logs it and leaves the adapter's flag
  exactly as it was — a slow probe neither marks an adapter expired (which
  would refuse *every* dispatch fleet-wide) nor recovers one a dying worker
  just flagged. A genuinely broken CLI still fails, loudly, at the spawn it
  would have failed at anyway — which is exactly the state the fleet was in
  before any pre-flight existed. Every other outcome (a 401, exhausted credit,
  a missing CLI) is conclusive evidence and still counts.

  An operator who wants a timeout to count against the adapter sets:

      config :arbiter, Arbiter.Agents.Preflight, on_timeout: :refuse

  which turns the timeout back into an `{:error, reason}` — note that with the
  `:preflight_timeout` category it still is not `:auth_expired`, so it is a
  logged non-auth failure rather than a fleet-wide refusal.

  ## Configuration

      config :arbiter, Arbiter.Agents.Preflight,
        # install-wide watchdog default (falls back to 30s)
        timeout_ms: 30_000,
        # per-adapter watchdog — resolution order: `:timeout_ms` opt, this map,
        # `:timeout_ms` above, the built-in per-provider default, 30s
        timeout_ms_by_provider: %{"gemini" => 120_000},
        # `:proceed` (default) | `:refuse`
        on_timeout: :proceed

  The watchdog was a bare module attribute until bd-svczq4, shared by every
  adapter and reachable from no CLI or MCP dispatch path — every real dispatch
  got 30s and the operator had no lever at all. The per-provider default for
  `gemini` is above `agy`'s observed cold-start floor on the arbiter host.

  ## Where the probe runs (bd-svczq4)

  `Port.open` carried no `:cd`, so the probe inherited the BEAM's cwd — on the
  dogfooded host, `/home/ryan/dev/arbiter`, the live checkout Phoenix
  hot-reloads from. An agy probe's generated settings carry
  `toolPermission: "always-proceed"`; the failing run only *read* six files,
  but nothing in the argv stopped the next one writing, and a write there has
  taken the install down before. Every probe now runs in `probe_cwd/0`, an
  empty directory under the system temp dir.

  A probe that outruns its watchdog also has its **process tree killed**
  (`Arbiter.Worker.OsProcess.kill_tree/1`): `Port.close/1` does not reap a
  `:spawn_executable` child, and the agy probe that triggered this ticket
  outlived the watchdog by 72 seconds, still calling the API.

  ## The CLI's own result is the verdict (bd-svczq4)

  A clean exit *plus* a successful structured result object is conclusive: the
  probe authenticated. The lines around it are not re-scanned for failure
  signatures, because they are the agent's work product, not a diagnostic about
  our credentials — and treating them as one was dangerous. Measured live on
  2026-09-18: agy, carrying the Arbiter-worker `GEMINI.md` from its isolated
  HOME, answered `ping` with a 14-step agentic turn that shelled out to
  `arb prime`. The backlog it printed contained a task titled "…generalise the
  401-shaped detection", and the classifier read that text as `:auth_expired` —
  which, from the `CredentialWatchdog`, marks the adapter dead and refuses every
  dispatch for it fleet-wide. The same run also drew `:context_thrash` from
  agy's falling per-step `input_tokens`.

  `Arbiter.Usage.Probe.parse/1` only yields usage for a *successful* result
  payload (Claude's `is_error`, agy's non-SUCCESS `status`), so a CLI that
  reports its own failure still falls through to the classifier, as does one
  that prints an auth error and exits 0 without any result object at all.

  That the probe is *still an agentic turn* — 7 `run_command` calls and ~71K
  input tokens to say "pong" — is not fixed here. The neutral cwd (below) means
  it has no repo to wander into, and bd-2jgs2h means it no longer runs per
  dispatch, so what remains is cost and noise on the Watchdog's poll rather than
  a correctness problem.

  ## The spend this costs (bd-adyhvn, bd-2jgs2h)

  A probe is not free: a one-word prompt still ships the CLI's whole system
  prompt and tool definitions (~39K cache-read tokens a call, measured). The
  per-dispatch/per-resume caller is gone (bd-2jgs2h), so what remains is the
  Watchdog's poll — one round-trip per probed adapter per interval, bounded by
  its `:adapters` setting, which the operator can empty. Every probe that
  actually spawns writes one `usage_events` row with `source: :preflight` via
  `Arbiter.Usage.Probe` — carrying real token counts when the CLI returned a
  structured result, and an explained null cost when it didn't. The ledger
  write is best-effort and never changes the verdict.

  A `:skipped` (adapter has no probe) or an un-runnable probe (CLI missing)
  writes nothing: no process ran, so nothing was spent.

  ## Test injection

  Pass `:probe_command` (an argv list) to bypass the adapter and run an
  arbitrary script — tests use this to simulate a 401 / a clean ping without a
  real CLI. `:probe_env` overrides the spawn env; `:timeout_ms` overrides the
  default wait.
