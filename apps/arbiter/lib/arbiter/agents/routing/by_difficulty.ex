defmodule Arbiter.Agents.Routing.ByDifficulty do
  @moduledoc """
  Routing policy: pick an agent config based on the task's `difficulty`
  (0..5 / D0..D5). Sibling to `:by_priority`; difficulty answers "how
  hard?" (drives model + thinking) while priority answers "how urgent?"
  (drives scheduling order). The two are orthogonal — both can be set on
  a task, and a workspace can opt into one or the other.

  ## Provider-agnostic abstractions

  The policy emits two abstract knobs in the chosen agent config:

    * `"model_tier"` — `"economy"` | `"standard"` | `"premium"`. A workspace
      may define further tiers of its own (the live installs add
      `"flagship"`); source knows only these three.
    * `"thinking"`   — `"none"` | `"low"` | `"medium"` | `"high"` | `"xhigh"`
                       | `"max"` (abstract reasoning effort, ascending).

  Each adapter's `Config` maps these to its own concrete knobs:

    * Claude — tier → `haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus`;
      thinking → reasoning-effort flag.
    * Gemini — tier → `flash-lite` / `flash` / `pro`;
      thinking → thinkingBudget / reasoning flag.

  Routing rubric stays abstract; provider knobs live inside each adapter.

  ## Default mapping (D0..D5)

      D0 → economy  / none
      D1 → economy  / low
      D2 → standard / medium    ← also the fallback when difficulty is unset
      D3 → premium  / high
      D4 → premium  / max
      D5 → premium  / max       ← flagship only via workspace `routing.rules`

  A task with `difficulty: nil` is treated as D2 (the common-feature
  default).

  ### Why D5 is `premium / max` in source (#1519)

  The flagship tier is not a source concept: `"flagship"` exists only where a
  workspace defines `agent.config.tier_models.flagship`, and D5's real job is
  to route there via `routing.rules.D5`. If the source default named
  `"flagship"` anyway, an install that has *not* defined that tier would get
  `model_for_tier("flagship") == nil` — no `--model` flag, so the CLI's own
  default model, which is *weaker* than the `premium` a D4 gets. Defaulting
  D5 to the strongest thing source can actually resolve makes an
  unconfigured install degrade sensibly rather than silently downgrade.

  D4 and D5 therefore coincide in source. That is deliberate and unlike the
  old D3/D4 collision: D4 is the top tier source can express, and D5's
  distinction is supplied entirely by workspace config.

  ## Known weakness: evidence-heavy ACs on the economy tier (bd-80talz)

  bd-aro53b was filed D1, so it routed to economy (agy on
  `gemini-3.8-flash-low`). Its ACs asked for two-theme screenshots and
  officially sourced artwork, which a headless worker cannot always produce.
  The worker fabricated both, and its rerun at standard completed honestly.

  The decision is to fix this where difficulty is set, not with an AC-keyword
  floor in this policy. `Arbiter.Sessions.RefineDoctrine` rates such ACs at
  least D2 (never economy, for every provider) and requires each to name an
  honest fallback. A keyword floor here would guess at prose, silently change
  cost fleet-wide, and not stop a stronger model from faking an AC it cannot
  meet either. What catches fabrication at any tier is the worker prompt's
  evidence-integrity rule, the `:no_public_upload` deny list, and the
  ReviewGate escalating a fabricated-evidence finding to the coordinator
  (`Arbiter.Worker.EvidenceIntegrity`).

  ## Workspace overrides

  `workspace.config["routing"]["rules"]` is consulted with the task's
  difficulty key (`"D0".."D5"`). A matching rule is merged on top of the
  default mapping for that tier; any key the rule omits keeps the default.
  Unknown keys (e.g. a workspace that pins `"model"` directly) are
  passed through so power users can bypass the abstraction when needed.

  ## Example workspace config

      %{
        "agent" => %{
          "type" => "claude",
          "config" => %{}
        },
        "routing" => %{
          "policy" => "by_difficulty",
          "rules" => %{
            "D0" => %{"model_tier" => "economy", "thinking" => "none"},
            "D5" => %{"model_tier" => "flagship", "thinking" => "xhigh"}
          }
        }
      }

  A task with `difficulty: 2` (no rule) gets the D2 default
  (standard / medium); a task with `difficulty: 0` gets the rule above
  (economy / none).
