defmodule Arbiter.Agents.Claude.Security do
  @moduledoc """
  Translates a provider-agnostic `Arbiter.Agents.SecurityPolicy` into the
  Claude Code CLI's concrete permission mechanism.

  This is the Claude side of the policy seam: `SecurityPolicy` says *what*
  ("auto mode, deny destructive ops, no network"), this module says *how* in
  Claude's vocabulary. A second provider gets its own analogue and the
  normalized policy stays untouched.

  ## Mapping

  | Normalized mode | Claude argv | Deny enforced? |
  |---|---|---|
  | `:bypass` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` + `--settings` | **yes** (deny list applied) |
  | `:auto`   | `--permission-mode auto`                        | yes |
  | `:strict` | `--permission-mode default`                     | yes (unallowed ⇒ blocked) |

  The allow/deny rules ride on a generated settings document passed inline as
  `--settings '<json>'` (the CLI accepts a JSON string, not just a file — so
  there is no shared-file race between concurrent workers, and nothing is
  read from the operator's `~/.claude`). The settings carry:

    * the expanded `safe_defaults` deny baseline (always non-empty unless the
      domain opted out),
    * the operator's extra `deny` rules,
    * `sandbox`-derived denies (network-egress tools when `network: false`),
    * the operator's `allow` rules,
    * `defaultMode` mirroring the chosen mode.

  `:bypass` is the headless-safe default. `--dangerously-skip-permissions` skips
  the interactive approval classifier (preventing headless freezes) but deny rules
  in `--settings` are a separate, orthogonal mechanism — they are hard tool-level
  blocks enforced before the classifier. So `--dangerously-skip-permissions` +
  `--settings` with deny rules gives the desired posture: no interactive freeze,
  deny list still enforced.

  ## Honesty about enforcement level

  These are *permission-layer* guards inside the agent, not a kernel sandbox.
  They stop the agent's own tools from running a denied command, which is the
  failure mode of the motivating incident (a worker's own `git merge` /
  destructive op). They do **not** jail the OS process — a determined escape
  (e.g. a sub-subprocess) is out of scope here; genuine OS isolation
  (`sandbox.enabled` at the kernel level) is a documented follow-up. Bash
  prefix matching is also approximate (`rm -rf` is denied; an obfuscated
  `rm  -rf` or `rm -r -f` is covered by extra patterns but not exhaustively).
  The guarantee is "non-empty, meaningful deny by default", a strict
  improvement over the empty-deny inheritance it replaces.
