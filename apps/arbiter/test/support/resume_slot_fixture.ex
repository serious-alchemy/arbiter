defmodule Arbiter.Test.ResumeSlotFixture do
  @moduledoc """
  A full cap as a fixture (bd-92mx1m), shared by every surface that resumes a
  task: a real git repo, `conductor_system_max_concurrent = 1`, task A
  dispatched, parked (its worker lingers `:failed`) and then moved out of In
  progress — its PR opened, so it is `:merging` and holds no slot
  (bd-asxw4e) — and task B admitted into the slot A freed, `:active`.

  Before bd-asxw4e this was the 2026-09-23 incident verbatim: a worker parked
  for a human released its task's slot. Under the ticket rule a parked ticket
  is still In progress and keeps its slot, so the fixture releases A the way
  the rule does — by leaving In progress.

  Every agent CLI is stubbed (`Arbiter.TestSandbox`), so a resume that
  succeeds spawns a sleeping stub, never the operator's real CLI.

  Real enough that `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.resume/2` gets all the way to
  the slot gate on A — preserved worktree, known repo, prior run — so a
  surface's test proves the gate where it actually sits.

  Call `setup_incident/1` from a test's `setup` (it registers its own
  `on_exit` cleanup), with a workspace. It returns `%{a: issue, b: issue,
  first: dispatch_result}`.
