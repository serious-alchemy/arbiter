defmodule Arbiter.TestSandbox do
  @moduledoc """
  Provision a throwaway repo sandbox for tests that drive real dispatch.

  Written for bd-b6noq9 / #1930. Four ephemeral tasks (`fp-7zn1p7`,
  `fp-6u0wu1`, `cr-ag13cz`, `fp-ry8klj`) were lost to one fixture shape:

      tmp = Path.join(System.tmp_dir!(), "rev-provider-\#{unique}")
      ...                       # repo/, origin.git, worktrees/, bin/
      on_exit(fn -> File.rm_rf!(tmp) end)

  Three separate hazards, each of which this module removes:

    1. **Under `/tmp`.** On the dogfood host that is a `tmpfs` swept daily by
       `systemd-tmpfiles`. Sandboxes go under
       `Arbiter.Config.Paths.scratch_root/0` instead — disk-backed, and no
       janitor's business.

    2. **Bare origin co-located with the worktree.** One `rm_rf` took the
       worktree, the `origin.git` and therefore the only copy of the branch,
       which is what made the loss unrecoverable rather than merely
       disruptive. `provision!/2` puts the origin under a *separate* root, so
       losing the disposable side still leaves something to re-clone from.

    3. **Teardown racing a live run.** `on_exit` fired while agent sessions
       spawned into the sandbox were still working. `teardown/2` stops the
       processes that own the sandbox and waits for them to be gone before it
       deletes anything — and if an owner will not stop, it leaves the
       sandbox on disk rather than destroying a live run's only checkout.
       "Stops" means through `terminate/2` (`Arbiter.ProcessTeardown.stop/2`),
       because that callback is where a worker reaps its agent's OS process:
       an owner that died without running it leaves the agent alive in a
       directory about to be deleted, which is the same race by another route.

  A fourth hazard was what turned a fixture bug into a live incident: the
  original fixture stubbed `agy` but not `claude`, so a dispatch that resolved
  to Claude executed the operator's **real** CLI inside the sandbox — which is
  why prose written by a live agent, escalating over `arb` to the live
  coordinator, showed up for tasks that exist in no database. `provision!/2`
  stubs every binary in `agent_binaries/0` and puts that directory first on
  `PATH`, so no spawn can reach a real agent CLI.

  Provision a sandbox tagged `tag`.

  Returns a map of paths plus an `:owners` agent holding the pids whose
  lifetime the sandbox belongs to (see `own!/2`). Registers an `on_exit`
  teardown, so callers that finish cleanly need not call `teardown/2`
  themselves.

  ## Options

    * `:stub` — body (a `sh` script, without the shebang) written for every
      agent binary. Defaults to a stub that logs its argv to `log` and prints
      `arb done`. Pass a map to vary the body per binary; any binary the map
      omits still gets the default, so no binary is ever left unstubbed.
