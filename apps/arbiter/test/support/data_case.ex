  Make the sandbox connection finish processing the death of every client this
  test killed, before the connection is handed to the next test (bd-5scl0c).

  When a process dies while holding a checkout, it does not notify anybody:
  the BEAM gives its holder ETS table away, and
  `DBConnection.Ownership.Proxy` turns that `ETS-TRANSFER` into
  `client #PID<..> exited` and disconnects (`proxy.ex:153`). Erlang orders
  signals per sender/receiver *pair* only, so observing the client's death
  elsewhere — e.g. ExUnit waiting on the test supervisor's `:DOWN` before it
  runs `on_exit` — says nothing about whether the proxy has handled the
  give-away yet. Left alone, that disconnect regularly landed a few hundred
  microseconds into the *next* test, which by then owns the connection:
  measured over 5 full `apps/arbiter_web` runs, 7 disconnects landed mid-test
  without this barrier and 0 with it.

  One synchronous round-trip fixes the ordering without any waiting: a
  `gen_server` handles its mailbox in order, so by the time our query comes
  back, every `ETS-TRANSFER` already queued ahead of it has been processed and
  the disconnect (if any) has landed here, inside the owning test's teardown,
  where the connection is about to be handed back anyway.

  Everything is caught: the proxy may *already* have shut down over exactly
  such a transfer, and a teardown helper must never be the thing that fails a
  green test.
