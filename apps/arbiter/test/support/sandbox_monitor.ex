defmodule Arbiter.Test.SandboxMonitor do
  @moduledoc """
  Detects — and attributes — sandbox connection kills during the test suite
  (bd-5scl0c).

  The whole suite shares **one** physical SQLite connection (`pool_size: 1`,
  see `config/test.exs`). If any process is killed, or crashes, while it holds
  a checkout on that connection, DBConnection has to assume the connection is
  in an unknown state. It logs

      Exqlite.Connection (#PID<...>) disconnected:
        ** (DBConnection.ConnectionError) client #PID<...> exited

  drops the physical connection — rolling back the sandbox transaction — and
  stops the owning `DBConnection.Ownership.Proxy`.

  Nothing in the default output marks that as a problem: it is one `[error]`
  line in a suite that logs thousands of expected warnings, and the damage
  lands somewhere else entirely. That is why it reached CI as an
  unreproducible cascade of failures in files the branch never touched.

  ## Two classes, only one of which is a bug

  * **mid-test** — a live test's connection is pulled out from under it. Every
    later query in that test raises `DBConnection.OwnershipError`, which call
    sites routinely swallow into a misleading `:not_found` (e.g.
    `Arbiter.MCP.Tools.fetch_graph/2` turns it into "graph ... not found"), and
    `async: false` tests take every other process in the VM with them because
    shared mode reverts to `:manual`. This is the class that produced the CI
    cascade.

  * **teardown** — the process died after its test's process had already
    exited, e.g. `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` killing a LiveView that still had a
    queued PubSub echo to handle when the test ended (ExUnit exits the test
    process with `:shutdown`, and `Phoenix.LiveView.Channel` does not trap
    exits). The owner is the test that just finished and is about to hand the
    connection back anyway, so no *other* test observes the loss — but that
    test's own `on_exit` callbacks run after the kill, and any DB read in one
    of them (e.g. `Worker.stop/2` by task id) sees the dead proxy: a raise,
    or an exit from the checkout (bd-jw7cb0).

  The discriminator is whether any test process registered with `track/3` was
  still alive when the disconnect fired.

  ## Why this reports rather than fails

  The report is deliberately not a gate. The disconnect is logged several
  asynchronous message hops after the process actually died — pool, proxy,
  connection — so a kill that happened squarely inside a test's teardown can
  still be logged a few microseconds into the next test and look "mid-test".
  Failing on that would trade one CI flake for another, which is exactly what
  bd-5scl0c set out to remove. Read the report; the fix belongs in whatever
  kills the process.
