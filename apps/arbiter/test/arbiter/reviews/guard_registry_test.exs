defmodule Arbiter.Reviews.GuardRegistryTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The two tests that give `Arbiter.Reviews.GuardRegistry` teeth (design #1635
  §5.4, P8).

  1. **Completeness** — every refusal path the AST scan finds in the six
     control-plane modules is accounted for: it is either a registry row's site
     or an entry in `@non_guard_sites` with a reason. Adding an escalation or a
     `Worker.fail/2` to any of those modules fails this file until it is
     declared. Both lists are also asserted to be free of stale entries, so a
     deleted function cannot leave a row or an exemption behind.

  2. **Policy conformance** — every row has a class, a finite bound and an
     episode key; no bound is infinite; no class-A or class-F row reaches
     `Worker.fail/2`; no row converts a guard misfire into `Run.status =
     :failed`. The rows that break those rules today are enumerated in
     `GuardRegistry.known_violations/0`, each naming the §7 phase that removes
     it, and that list is frozen here so it can only shrink.
