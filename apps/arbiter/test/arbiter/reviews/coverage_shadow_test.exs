  P3 of `docs/review-coverage-and-guard-policy.md` (design #1635), §3.4/§6.3:
  the **shadow** evaluator both merge paths call alongside the existing
  `last_reviewed_sha` guard.

  Everything here is about the two properties P3 has to hold:

    * `observe/1` never changes and never crashes the merge decision — it
      returns `:ok` for *every* input, including ones whose `ctx` lookups
      raise; and
    * a disagreement is legible without grepping a journal — exactly one
      `:warning` line naming both answers, plus a durable counter row.
