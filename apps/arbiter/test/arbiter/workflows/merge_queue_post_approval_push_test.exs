  P7 (bd-60r6wp / #1738) — the MergeQueue half of §4.5: a conflict-resolver
  push onto an approved PR is no longer treated as reviewed.

  Before P7 the queue's `clear_reviewed_latch/1` suspended the guard for the
  resolver's force-push and re-latched onto whatever head it produced, so a
  resolution that wrote content merged with no review having seen it. Now the
  approved baseline stays pinned: a resolution whose net diff equals the
  approved one merges on a `:mechanical` coverage row, and one that authored
  content is refused until a review covers it.
