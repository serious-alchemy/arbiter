defmodule Arbiter.Worker.WatchdogPostApprovalPushTest do
  @moduledoc """
  P7 (bd-60r6wp / #1738) — `docs/review-coverage-and-guard-policy.md` §4.5.

  A post-approval CI `fix_pass`, or a conflict-resolver push, is the FLEET
  advancing an approved branch. Before P7 `clear_reviewed_latch/1` suspended
  the guard for both and then re-latched onto whatever head landed, so the old
  `last_reviewed_sha` path stamped the fix-pass commit as reviewed and merged
  it. P3's shadow caught three PRs that merged that way (#1702, #1723, #1725).

  After P7:

    * the fleet's authored push keeps the approved baseline, so the old path
      never treats the new head as reviewed (AC1);
    * a push whose net diff equals the approved one merges and leaves a
      `:mechanical` coverage row behind it (AC2);
    * a push that changed content routes to a review round instead of merging
      (AC3 — the delta scoping of that round is pinned in
      `review_gate_delta_scope_test.exs`);
    * flag on, `decide/3` refuses the same heads; flag off, the shadow records
      no `authored_content` disagreement for them (AC4).

  bd-741sid: the Watchdog is keyed by the ticket and drives it; no worker is
  paired with it. A merge is read off its announcement (`Watchdog.subscribe/1`)
  and the ticket row, where it used to complete the worker.
