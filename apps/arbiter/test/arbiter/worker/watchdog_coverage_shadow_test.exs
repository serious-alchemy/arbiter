defmodule Arbiter.Worker.WatchdogCoverageShadowTest do
  @moduledoc """
  P3 (bd-b0fqcl / #1649) — the Watchdog's merge-guard path in **shadow mode**.

  The contract these tests hold is narrow and entirely about *non*-behaviour:
  the Watchdog still merges (or refuses) exactly what
  `Arbiter.Mergers.ReviewedSha` says, and the only thing
  `Arbiter.Reviews.Coverage.decide/3` is allowed to do on the way past is
  count and log. A test that asserted the coverage predicate's own answer
  belongs in `coverage_decide_test.exs`; what belongs here is that the merge
  came out the same either way.

  bd-741sid: the Watchdog is keyed by the ticket and drives it; no worker is
  paired with it. A merge is read off its announcement (`Watchdog.subscribe/1`)
  and the ticket row, where it used to complete the worker.
