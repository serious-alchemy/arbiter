defmodule Arbiter.Worker.ReviewGatePushGateTest do
  @moduledoc """
  bd-2jkrqu / #1701 — the ReviewGate reviewed the worker's LOCAL head, not the
  pushed PR head.

  vs-5l45oz (vstim MR !228), 2026-09-15: round 1 said REQUEST_CHANGES; the fix
  round committed `edadf22c` in the worktree and never pushed; origin and the
  MR's pipeline stayed on the unfixed `8deed4e5`. Round 2 read the **local**
  worktree, marked every finding `[ADDRESSED]` citing lines that only existed
  locally, and APPROVED. The park escalation then said "the work is committed
  and the branch is pushed … merge it by hand, if the diff is fine" — a human
  following it would have merged the unfixed commit. Two days earlier
  (vs-bdrbp0) a timed-out fix round left sixteen commits unpushed.

  What is pinned here, against real git repos with a real bare origin:

    * **AC1** — no review round runs against a head that is not on the remote
      branch. Round 1 and the fix round's re-review both push first; a head
      that *cannot* be pushed (diverged) parks `:head_not_pushed` and the
      reviewer is never paid for.
    * **AC2** — the reviewed-SHA stamp and the `review_coverage` row only ever
      name a head the remote carries.
    * **AC3** — the park escalation states the push state it *checked*, and
      withholds "merge it by hand" when the PR head is not the reviewed head.

  The reviewer fixture (`review_push_check.sh`) encodes the push state it saw
  in its own verdict, so a regression shows up as a REQUEST_CHANGES rather
  than as a test that passes for the wrong reason.
