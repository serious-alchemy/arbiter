defmodule Arbiter.Worker.SubordinateStopAttributionTest do
  # bd-8lq2g7 / #1204 — a *subordinate* worker's death must not masquerade as the
  # task's primary worker dying.
  #
  # The merge queue starts subordinate workers under the task's OWN `task_id` but
  # a distinct registry key: the CI fix pass (`<task_id>:fixpass`, meta role
  # `:fix_pass`) and the conflict resolver (`<task_id>:conflict`). They run while
  # the primary author worker is parked at `:awaiting_review` awaiting the merge.
  #
  # When such a subordinate's agent exits 0 without `arb done`, the pre-fix code
  # ran the whole primary-worker failure path keyed on the base `task_id`:
  #
  #   * `Arbiter.Events.broadcast(ws, "worker_failed", %{task_id: task_id})`
  #     — which the API event stream reports as "the worker for <task>
  #     stopped";
  #   * a Coordinator escalation subject `"<task_id> stopped — exited without
  #     completing (exit 0)"` whose remediation reads "Resume: run `arb worker
  #     resume <task_id>`".
  #
  # Both are false: the task's own worker is alive and healthy at
  # `:awaiting_review`. Following that remediation is what produced the reported
  # loop — `worker_resume` is refused ("a worker is still active for this task
  # (awaiting_review)"), so the operator stops the healthy primary, and the
  # re-dispatch re-runs the whole ReviewGate from round 1.
  #
  # async: false — Port + Worker registry are global; DataCase gives the DB
  # sandbox the escalation + Run writes need.
