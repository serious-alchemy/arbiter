  @moduledoc """
  bd-bq8c8a / #1860 — a ReviewGate fix round must not commit on top of a head
  the remote has already moved past.

  leotech `lt-20r7zu`, `admin_server` PR #424, 2026-09-17. Round 1 said
  REQUEST_CHANGES at 16:29:52 and dispatched an implementer. At 16:30:10
  PRPatrol's fix worker pushed `aed4457` to `origin/<branch>`. At ~16:30:30 the
  gate's implementer committed `19665a3` on the worktree — a child of the same
  parent, containing none of the patrol's work. The push at 16:30:38 was
  rejected `:diverged`, the run recorded `review_parked` and the task parked
  `head_not_pushed`. Recovery was manual.

  The gate never fetched between the reviewer's verdict and the implementer's
  commit, so it could not see the remote move and its push could only fail.

  What is pinned here, against real git repos with a real bare origin:

    * the fix round fetches and compares before the implementer is launched;
    * when the remote advanced, the implementer never runs — so there is no
      orphan commit and no `:impl` round row;
    * the gate fast-forwards onto the new remote head and opens a FRESH review
      round on it, instead of parking `head_not_pushed`;
    * that fresh round's prompt says what actually happened — nobody addressed
      the findings — instead of the default "the implementer has addressed your
      prior findings", which would push the reviewer to disposition its own
      open findings `[ADDRESSED]` against a diff that never targeted them
      (the bd-6r8caj property);
    * the branch is otherwise untouched: `origin/<branch>` still carries the
      other actor's commit.

  The reviewer fixture (`review_remote_advance.sh`) encodes the push state it
  read into its own verdict, so a regression shows up as a REQUEST_CHANGES
  rather than as a test that passes for the wrong reason.
