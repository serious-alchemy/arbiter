defmodule Arbiter.Worker.StopRedispatchTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression tests for bd-cgmidt: `worker_stop` followed by an immediate
  re-`worker_dispatch` must not leave a live worker attached to a `:closed`
  task (the 2026-07-08 apex-client#3266 / lt-c9td4r orphan).

  Root cause: `Dispatch.dispatch/2` guards `:closed` only ONCE, at the front of
  the pipeline (`ensure_not_closed/1`), then transitions to `:active`,
  provisions a worktree, and starts the worker. An asynchronous close landing
  inside that window — in production the MergeQueue direct-strategy close of an
  in-flight `{:worker_done}` from the just-stopped run — flips the bead to
  `:closed` AFTER the front guard passed but BEFORE the new worker is attached.
  The close's own `StopWorker` after-action finds no live worker to stop (the
  old one was already torn down by `worker_stop`, the new one not yet started),
  so the freshly-started worker is orphaned on a `:closed` task.

  The invariant under test: when `dispatch/2` returns `{:ok, _}` with a live
  worker, the task is NEVER `:closed`; a bead that raced to `:closed` inside the
  dispatch window is atomically reopened so the live worker is realigned, never
  orphaned. And `worker_stop` (teardown) never closes the bead.
