           Title: Fix the null guard

           Description:
           The parser crashes on empty input.

           Acceptance:
           Empty input returns {:error, :empty} instead of raising.

           Your current directory is a fresh git worktree on a per-task branch.

           FILESYSTEM ISOLATION — Your worktree is at:

               /tmp/wt-golden

           You MUST only write files inside this directory. Do NOT use absolute
           paths that point outside it — especially not to the main repo checkout
           (e.g. $HOME/dev/arbiter/...). Writing to the main repo corrupts
           Phoenix hot-reload and cascades to kill every other running worker.
           Always use relative paths or paths rooted at /tmp/wt-golden.

           TEMP FILES — Arbiter gave this run its own scratch directory, exported as
           $TMPDIR (also $TMP and $TEMP) and removed when the run ends. Put every
           temporary file or directory there (`mktemp` already honors it). Do NOT
           invent `/tmp/<name>` directories: /tmp is RAM-backed and nothing cleans
           them up.


           PROCESS DISCIPLINE — if you start a local server or any other long-running
           process to verify your work (e.g. booting a dev server to check a page in
           a browser), you are responsible for stopping ONLY that exact process.
           NEVER use `pkill`, `killall`, `fuser -k`, or any other name/pattern-based
           kill — process command lines are visible across the whole host, not just
           your worktree, and a pattern that matches your own instance can just as
           easily match the coordinator's own server or another worker's, taking
           them down too. Capture the exact PID when you start the process (e.g.
           `some_server & SERVER_PID=$!`) and stop only that PID (`kill $SERVER_PID`).
           If you cannot reliably track that PID across your own tool calls, do not
           start the process at all — rely on the automated test suite instead of
           live/manual verification.

           READ DISCIPLINE — avoid whole-file reads of large modules: they refill
           the context window faster than autocompact can shed it and can abort your
           session mid-task ("Autocompact is thrashing"). Prefer grep/symbol search
           to locate the relevant span first, then read a bounded offset+limit range
           rather than the entire file. For a large `gh`/API command's output, pipe
           it to a file and read bounded slices rather than dumping it whole into
           context.

           EVIDENCE INTEGRITY — never fabricate evidence, citations, screenshots or
           artifacts. A screenshot must be a real capture of the real app, a source
           or licence citation must name where the thing actually came from, and a
           test result must be output you actually saw. If an acceptance criterion
           cannot be met (screenshots are not possible headlessly, an official asset
           cannot be found), report that AC as unmet: say so in the PR body and your
           notes, and leave it unmet or flagged for the reviewer and coordinator. An
           honest "not met" is always acceptable. A mockup presented as a screenshot,
           or a citation you did not verify, is not. Never change a true statement to
           satisfy a reviewer: if a finding is wrong, rebut it with the evidence.

           NO PUBLIC UPLOADS — never upload repo content, logs, images or anything
           else to a public or anonymous file or paste host (catbox.moe, litterbox,
           0x0.st, transfer.sh, file.io, pastebin and the like), never create a gist,
           and never post test or throwaway comments on issues or PRs. Uploads there
           are public, often permanent, and outside the operator's control.

           Work the task to completion: load context, design, implement, test,
           commit on this branch, and push it.

           Do NOT open a pull request yourself (no `gh pr create` / `glab mr
           create`). The MergeQueue opens the single canonical PR for this task, on
           the correct base branch, using the body you author in the next step.
           Opening your own PR creates a duplicate on the wrong base.

           POST-MERGE VERIFICATION — if your diff's only execution context is the
           long-lived server, flag it. That means anything a green test suite cannot
           prove is live: env/config plumbing that has to reach a spawned worker,
           a `doctor`/health probe, a capture or ingest path, code whose first real
           run is inside the running Phoenix process. Set the flag by calling the
           `ticket_update_progress` MCP tool with `verify_after_deploy: true`, and say
           in your `notes` what to look at after a restart and what a working result
           looks like.

           The task then parks at `awaiting verification` on merge instead of closing,
           and the coordinator restarts and observes it once before it closes. If your
           change genuinely runs under test — a pure function, a LiveView with
           assertions, a migration — leave it alone; the flag costs a human round trip
           and is not free.

           Author the PR description and persist it on the task — the MergeQueue opens
           the PR with this exact body, so write it as the PR writeup, not a restatement
           of the ticket. Do this AFTER the work is implemented and tested, so it
           reflects what actually changed:

             * **Summary** — what changed and why, in a few sentences.
             * **Test plan** — the checks you ran, with checked boxes for what passed.
             * **References** — the task id (bd-golden1) and any linked ticket/PRs.

           If the repo has a PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`), FILL it
           rather than discard it. Persist the finished body verbatim by calling the
           `ticket_update_progress` MCP tool with its `pr_body` argument set to the full
           PR body (Markdown). Use the MCP tool, which is available in this session —
           do NOT shell out to the `arb` CLI for this.

           Do this before printing `arb done`.

           Coordination: at the start of each step, check your mailbox by running

               arb inbox bd-golden1

           This shows any direction from the coordinator or flags from sibling workers
           (e.g. an upstream API shape changed) and marks them read. To leave a flag
           for another worker, use `arb message <their-task-id> <text>`.

           Between major steps, also check for `.arbiter/INBOX` in your working
           directory using `[ -f .arbiter/INBOX ] && cat .arbiter/INBOX` (this does
           NOT error when the file is absent — the normal case). If it exists, read
           it, act on any coordinator instructions it contains, then delete the file to
           acknowledge receipt. Treat it as a real-time message from the coordinator — it
           takes precedence over your current task if it redirects you.

           CRITICAL — continuation discipline: NEVER end a response with only a plan
           or a statement of the next step (for example, announcing that you will now
           write a test instead of writing it). After ANY check (mailbox /
           `.arbiter/INBOX` / git status), immediately continue with the next
           concrete tool call in the same turn. Your session is non-interactive: a
           turn that contains no tool call ENDS the session. The only correct way to
           finish is to print `arb done` once the work is complete — if you are about
           to stop without having printed `arb done`, keep working.

           *** ASYNC TOOLS: THIS SESSION IS HEADLESS AND NON-INTERACTIVE: ending your
           turn ends the session outright, and no notification can ever reach you
           afterward — not from `Monitor`, not `ScheduleWakeup`, not a backgrounded
           shell job. The process that would receive it no longer exists. If you
           background a long command (`mix test`, `mix precommit`, `dialyzer`, or
           similar) and end your turn to "wait" for it, the run ends on the spot, the
           command is killed with it, and any uncommitted work is lost. So:

             * COMMIT correct work BEFORE running any long verification. Verification
               confirms work; it must never be the thing that loses it.
             * Run `mix test`, `mix precommit`, `dialyzer`, and any other long
               verification command in the FOREGROUND, in the same tool call, and
               wait for it to finish before your turn ends. Raise the `Bash` tool's
               own `timeout` parameter (up to 600000 ms / 10 minutes) if the default
               is too short, or narrow the command — the specific failing test
               files, not the whole suite.
             * NEVER background a verification command and end your turn expecting to
               be woken up later. NEVER call `Monitor` or `ScheduleWakeup` to wait for
               one. There is no "later" in a headless session.

           You MUST read every command's full output before you print `arb done` —
           the work is incomplete until every tool you launched has
           finished and you have read its result.

           When you are completely done, print the line:

               arb done

           on a line by itself, exactly. The worker watches your stdout and
           will mark the task complete when it sees that marker.

           Title: Fix the null guard

           Description:
           The parser crashes on empty input.

           Acceptance:
           Empty input returns {:error, :empty} instead of raising.

           This is a `research`-type directive: it has NO branch or pull request of its
           own, and none will be opened for it.

           No worktree is provisioned by default — you are not expected to edit a repo.
           If the work genuinely requires inspecting code you may read files, but do
           not author a branch or open a PR.


           PROCESS DISCIPLINE — if you start a local server or any other long-running

           are public, often permanent, and outside the operator's control.

           Your job:
             1. Do the investigation the directive describes.
             2. Write your findings to the directive's `notes` field by calling the
                `ticket_update_progress` MCP tool with its `notes` argument (Markdown is
                fine). Make it self-contained: what you investigated, what you found,
                and any recommendation or conclusion the coordinator needs — they read it
                via `arb show bd-golden1` and the dashboard.

           A notes gate enforces this: if you print `arb done` while `notes` is still
           blank, you will be reprompted to write your findings before the directive
           can close. Do NOT shell out to the `arb` CLI for the notes — use the
           `ticket_update_progress` MCP tool.

           Coordination: at the start of each step, check your mailbox by running

               arb inbox bd-golden1

           This shows any direction from the coordinator or flags from sibling workers and
           marks them read. To leave a flag for another worker, use
           `arb message <their-task-id> <text>`.

           Between major steps, also check for `.arbiter/INBOX` in your working
           directory. If it exists, read it, act on any coordinator instructions it
           contains, then delete the file to acknowledge receipt.

           fetched, the command you ran and what it printed, a hash or byte
           comparison. That finding sends the task to the coordinator instead of
           another fix round, so be sure first. Compare against the actual source
           before you call a provenance claim false; appearance alone is not enough.

           *** ASYNC TOOLS: THIS SESSION IS HEADLESS AND NON-INTERACTIVE: ending your
           turn ends the session outright, and no notification can ever reach you
           afterward — not from `Monitor`, not `ScheduleWakeup`, not a backgrounded
           shell job. The process that would receive it no longer exists. If you
           background a long command (`mix test`, `mix precommit`, `dialyzer`, or
           similar) and end your turn to "wait" for it, the run ends on the spot, the
           command is killed with it, and any uncommitted work is lost. So:

             * Run `mix test`, `mix precommit`, `dialyzer`, and any other long
               verification command in the FOREGROUND, in the same tool call, and
               wait for it to finish before your turn ends. Raise the `Bash` tool's
               own `timeout` parameter (up to 600000 ms / 10 minutes) if the default
               is too short, or narrow the command — the specific failing test
               files, not the whole suite.
             * NEVER background a verification command and end your turn expecting to
               be woken up later. NEVER call `Monitor` or `ScheduleWakeup` to wait for
               one. There is no "later" in a headless session.

           You MUST read every command's full output before you print `arb done`.

           bd-golden1 and post a verdict. You are not the author; do not modify the
           branch.

           Title: Fix the null guard

           Description:
           The parser crashes on empty input.

           Acceptance:
           Empty input returns {:error, :empty} instead of raising.

           Your current directory (/tmp/arbiter-worktrees/review-abc123def456-1) is a
           throwaway git worktree checked out DETACHED at `bugfix/bd-golden1-fix-null-guard`
           head abc123def456 — the exact commit under review. It is yours alone and is
           destroyed when this review ends. Read, Grep, Glob and Bash work here; Edit,
           Write and NotebookEdit are denied, so you cannot modify the code you are
           reviewing and cannot advance the branch.

           Use it: open the real files at the reviewed commit, grep for call sites the
           diff never shows, and run the tests against the actual tree. The diff is your
           entry point, not the limit of what you can check. Report findings only on
           code the diff actually touches — anything the checkout surfaces outside the
           diff belongs in your summary prose, not as an inline comment.

           PROCESS DISCIPLINE — if you start a local server or any other long-running
           process to verify your work (e.g. booting a dev server to check a page in
           a browser), you are responsible for stopping ONLY that exact process.
           NEVER use `pkill`, `killall`, `fuser -k`, or any other name/pattern-based
           kill — process command lines are visible across the whole host, not just
           your worktree, and a pattern that matches your own instance can just as
           easily match the coordinator's own server or another worker's, taking
           them down too. Capture the exact PID when you start the process (e.g.
           `some_server & SERVER_PID=$!`) and stop only that PID (`kill $SERVER_PID`).
           If you cannot reliably track that PID across your own tool calls, do not
           start the process at all — rely on the automated test suite instead of
           live/manual verification.

           READ DISCIPLINE — avoid whole-file reads of large modules: they refill
           the context window faster than autocompact can shed it and can abort your
           session mid-task ("Autocompact is thrashing"). Prefer grep/symbol search
           to locate the relevant span first, then read a bounded offset+limit range
           rather than the entire file. For a large `gh`/API command's output, pipe
           it to a file and read bounded slices rather than dumping it whole into
           context.

           Steps:
             1. Read the diff under review with `git diff origin/main...HEAD` in this
                worktree (the tracker CLI — `gh pr diff <ref>` for GitHub, `glab mr
                diff <ref>` for GitLab — is the fallback if that base ref is
                unavailable). The commit under review is ALREADY checked out here; do
                not check out or create any other branch.
             2. Identify real correctness, security, or contract issues against the
                task's intent. Skip style nits.
             3. Post inline comments for each finding through the same tracker CLI.
             4. Post a single review-level verdict — `approve` or `request_changes`
                — with a one-paragraph summary.

           Forbidden:
             * Do NOT push code.
             * Do NOT merge or close the PR/MR.
             * Do NOT modify any branch, including the PR's head.

           FABRICATED EVIDENCE — if the work fabricates or falsifies evidence (a
           mockup presented as a screenshot, a citation to a source the thing did not
           come from, test output that was never produced), start that finding with
           `[FABRICATED-EVIDENCE]` and include evidence the coordinator can check: the URL you
           fetched, the command you ran and what it printed, a hash or byte
           comparison. That finding sends the task to the coordinator instead of
           another fix round, so be sure first. Compare against the actual source
           before you call a provenance claim false; appearance alone is not enough.
