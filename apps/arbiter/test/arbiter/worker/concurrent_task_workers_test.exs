defmodule Arbiter.Worker.ConcurrentTaskWorkersTest do
  # bd-8tjcms / #1511 — a task must never have two *actively working* workers.
  #
  # `Arbiter.Worker` registers under a `:registry_key` that defaults to the
  # task_id, but the merge queue's subordinate passes deliberately take
  # `<task_id>:fixpass` / `<task_id>:conflict` so they can run alongside the
  # primary worker parked at `:awaiting_review` (bd-8lq2g7). Every "is a worker
  # already running for this task?" guard in `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch` looks up
  # the *exact* task_id key via `Worker.whereis/1`, so it cannot see a
  # subordinate — and `FixPassDispatcher` / `ConflictResolver` only guard their
  # own key. The two families are therefore mutually invisible, which is how
  # vs-ehjarz ended up with two live agent sessions on one task and one branch.
  #
  # The rule enforced here: at most one worker per task may be in an *active*
  # (agent-bearing) status. Parked (`:awaiting_review*`) and terminal
  # (`:failed` / `:completed`) workers still allow a new pass to start — that
  # coexistence is the documented merge-queue design and must not regress.
  #
  # async: false — the Worker registry and DynamicSupervisor are global.
