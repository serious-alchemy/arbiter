defmodule Arbiter.Worker.MissingWorktreeTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression tests for bd-7pe74i: a worker that fails to start / never
  provisions a worktree must NOT close its bead (silent task loss).

  Two failure modes are exercised:

    1. **Worktree-provision failure** — a reviewable code directive
       (`issue_type: :feature`) signals `arb done` with no per-task branch in
       meta (the worktree was never provisioned). The old behaviour completed
       the worker, broadcast `{:worker_done}`, and let the MergeQueue close the
       bead as `:done` on enqueue (the `:direct` path). The fix refuses:
       fail + escalate, leave the bead open, and never broadcast `{:worker_done}`.

    2. **Early agent failure** — the agent subprocess crashes (non-zero exit,
       the `{:claude_failed, N, ""}` shape) before producing any deliverable.
       The worker fails + escalates via the stop-reason path and the bead stays
       open. It must never be closed and never broadcast `{:worker_done}`.

  The invariant under test: a bead only reaches `:closed` via a real completion
  (merged PR) or an explicit human/finalizer close — NEVER from a
  worker-failure / teardown path.
