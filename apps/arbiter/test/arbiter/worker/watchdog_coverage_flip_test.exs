defmodule Arbiter.Worker.WatchdogCoverageFlipTest do
  @moduledoc """
  P4 (bd-df3zlo / #1736) — the Watchdog's **read-path flip**, behind
  `merge.coverage_enabled`.

  P3's tests (`watchdog_coverage_shadow_test.exs`) pin the flag-off half: the
  coverage predicate counts and logs and changes nothing. What this file pins
  is the other half, and the fact that the switch is the only difference
  between them:

    * the ctx now carries an `:ancestor?` probe, so §3.2's rule 2 is reachable
      and a forge-lag poll answers `{:unknown, :forge_lagging}` (AC1);
    * with the flag off, the old `last_reviewed_sha` guard still decides every
      merge, exactly as in P3 (AC2);
    * with the flag on, `Coverage.decide/3` decides and the old guard is the
      one shadowing — including where the two disagree (AC2);
    * a probe that cannot answer waits, bounded, and then parks and escalates
      once. It never merges (AC4).

  bd-741sid: the Watchdog is keyed by the ticket and drives it; no worker is
  paired with it. What a parked worker's status used to say is read off the
  Watchdog's own announcements (`Watchdog.subscribe/1`) and the ticket row.
