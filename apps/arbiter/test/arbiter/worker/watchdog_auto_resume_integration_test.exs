defmodule Arbiter.Worker.WatchdogAutoResumeIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  End-to-end proof of the bd-8eheb6 auto-resume loop with the REAL
  `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue.AutoResumeDispatcher` wired into a REAL
  `Arbiter.Worker.Watchdog` — no stub dispatcher anywhere.

  `Arbiter.Worker.WatchdogTest` pins the Watchdog's *decisions* against a stub;
  this pins the *wiring* between the three real modules a stub necessarily hides:

    * Watchdog timeout -> real `AutoResumeDispatcher.resume/1` ->
      real `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.resume/2` -> a real worker on the real,
      preserved worktree carrying the re-stamped attempt counter;
    * the give-up legs -> real `escalate_exhausted/5` -> a real `:escalation`
      row in the coordinator's mailbox.

  bd-741sid: every case starts from the state a real timeout now finds — the
  implementer's run ended when it opened the PR, and the ticket is Merging with
  the PR on its row. The Watchdog is keyed by the ticket, and the timeout is its
  `{:timed_out, polls}` announcement rather than a failed run.

    # `Arbiter.Worker.Driver`, and stopping that worker (the per-test `on_exit`s
    # below, which run *before* this one) fires the Driver's `:DOWN` handler.
    # That handler runs `maybe_cleanup_worktree/1` — a `git worktree remove`
    # plus a `File.rm_rf` — asynchronously, in the Driver's own process, on a
    # path underneath `tmp`. Blanket-deleting `tmp` while that is in flight is
    # two independent recursive deletes over overlapping paths, and it raises
    # `** (File.Error) ... file already exists` out of this very callback (CI
    # run 35050008350). So settle the Drivers first; production never
