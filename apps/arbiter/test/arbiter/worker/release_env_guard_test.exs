defmodule Arbiter.Worker.ReleaseEnvGuardTest do
  @moduledoc """
  bd-2oelme: a missed subprocess spawn only fails in release mode, which dev CI
  never exercises — so the inventory is asserted in a test instead.

  Four rules, all evaluated against the source of `apps/*/lib`:

    1. **Every spawned command is a literal drawn from the pure-tool
       allowlist.** `System.cmd/3`, `System.shell/1` and `:os.cmd/1` may only
       run a command that is spelled out as a literal string *and* appears in
       `@pure_tool_commands` (`git`, `gh`, `kill`, `diff`, …). Anything else —
       a BEAM/agent CLI (`mix`, `elixir`, `claude`, `arb`, …), a shell, or a
       command held in a variable — must go through
       `Arbiter.Worker.ReleaseEnv.cmd/3`, which is the only place an arbitrary
       command may be spawned. This is deliberately per-*occurrence*, not
       per-file, so a new bypass added to an already-classified file is caught
       too.
    2. **`Port.open/2` is allowlisted per occurrence.** A file that opens a
       port must be declared here *with its exact number of ports*, and must
       call `ReleaseEnv.port_env/1`, so a second port added to an
       already-listed file has to be classified too.
    3. **Every spawn site is classified.** A file containing any spawn
       primitive must appear in `@inventory`, so a new one can't land
       unclassified.
    4. **`:scrubbed` files really do reference `ReleaseEnv`.**

  When you add a spawn site, add its file to `@inventory` with the right
  classification — that is the whole maintenance cost.
