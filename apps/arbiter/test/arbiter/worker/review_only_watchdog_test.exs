defmodule Arbiter.Worker.ReviewOnlyWatchdogTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression tests for bd-4ji58d, bd-btcyn6, bd-ddtbhb, bd-bs3z04, and
  bd-4u7a1m.

  When a coordinator dispatches a reviewer via `worker_review` / `arb worker
  review`, the resulting worker is tagged `review_only: true` and has no
  branch/worktree.

  After bd-4u7a1m (hosted-forge Watchdog path):

    * APPROVE on a hosted-forge workspace (GitHub/GitLab) with a pr_ref →
      the ticket's Watchdog is started against the existing PR and drives the
      merge. The task must NOT reach :closed while the PR is still open.
      bd-741sid: the reviewer's run ends there — the Watchdog is the ticket's,
      not the worker's — and a review-only engagement stays open after the
      merge (bd-cw3w9p).
    * APPROVE on a :direct workspace (no hosted forge) → reviewer completes
      normally, Driver closes the task, MergeQueue receives the signal and
      closes the task without calling the forge merge API (bd-ddtbhb, bd-bs3z04).
    * REQUEST_CHANGES → reviewer worker fails (not completes) so the Driver
      does NOT close the task; it stays :in_progress for a fix-pass.
    * No verdict → same as REQUEST_CHANGES (fail, task stays :in_progress).
    * pr_ref absent → complete directly; Driver closes task.

  The full ReviewGate merge path (fleet-authored work: enter_review_gate →
  merge_branch) is a separate path. As of bd-dkwhbn it no longer forces a
  merge — it passes `via_review_gate: true` only, so the Watchdog's merge
  decision follows the workspace's `auto_merge` setting like any other lane.
  This module's `trigger_watchdog_on_approval` path (coordinator-dispatched
  review_only workers) mirrors that fix as of bd-38e34o: it also passes only
  `via_review_gate: true`, so a review_only APPROVE never bypasses a
  human-merge (`auto_merge: false`) workspace policy.

  bd-btcyn6 regression: a reviewer that submits the review verdict via the
  tracker CLI (`gh pr review`) and also emits the required `VERDICT:` sentinel
  before `arb done` must land in a clean terminal state — not failed/INCONCLUSIVE.
  The review prompt was updated to require the sentinel; these tests cover the
  adapter-submitted-verdict completion path.
