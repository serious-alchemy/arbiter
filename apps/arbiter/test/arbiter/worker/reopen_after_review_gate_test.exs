defmodule Arbiter.Worker.ReopenAfterReviewGateTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression test for bd-636thc: finalize's 422 "already exists" adoption
  (bd-8rrn9t / bd-8iad6a / bd-c5zu16) is implemented *inside* one call to
  `Arbiter.Mergers.Github.open/4` — a look-before-create GET, and (on a 422)
  a single reactive fallback GET. `Arbiter.Worker.FinalizePRAlreadyExistsTest`
  (#968) proves that single-call mechanism works when a PR was opened by
  some other process before the worker's *only* `open/4` call.

  It does NOT cover a worker with a review gate: `enter_review_gate` opens a
  real PR itself (bd-129xh4, `maybe_open_pr_for_review`) *before* the
  reviewer runs, then APPROVE drives a *second*, independent `open/4` call
  (`do_open_mr`) on the very same branch to actually integrate. If GitHub's
  PR-listing endpoint has a transient hiccup right when that second call's
  own look-before-create *and* its own 422 fallback both miss — plausible
  after a burst of review-related API traffic — bd-8rrn9t/bd-8iad6a's
  single-shot adoption inside that one `open/4` call is exhausted and the
  raw 422 bubbles up through `do_open_mr` -> `merge_branch` ->
  `park_merge_failure`, failing the run via `{:merge_failed, reason}` even
  though the worker's own earlier PR is sitting right there, open, on the
  same branch (bd-887swr run a7ce18d4).

  The fix: `Arbiter.Mergers.open_with_retry/5` retries the whole `open/4`
  call (not just the lookup inside it) when the failure is an "already
  exists" 409/422, giving the adoption lookup another shot. `Worker.safe_open/5`
  (shared by `do_open_mr` and `open_pr_without_merge`) and
  `MergeQueue.open_mr_for/4` (the auto-merge / MergeQueue path) both route
  through it, so every path that can open an MR for a task's own branch gets
  the same resilience.
