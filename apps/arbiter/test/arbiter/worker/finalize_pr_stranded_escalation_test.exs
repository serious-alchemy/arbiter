defmodule Arbiter.Worker.FinalizePRStrandedEscalationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression test for bd-28l6im's Wanted #3: "no task is parked failed
  while its PR is OPEN and MERGEABLE; that state escalates distinctly from a
  real work failure."

  `Mergers.open_with_retry/5` (bd-636thc, widened by bd-28l6im) gives the
  adoption lookup many chances to resolve an "already exists" 422 before
  giving up. If every one of those attempts still can't resolve a PR number
  — this test forces that by never returning one — the run genuinely cannot
  proceed automatically. It must still fail (there is no ref to adopt), but
  the escalation must say plainly that this is a PR-open collision likely
  to already be open and mergeable, not lump it in with an ordinary "could
  not be opened/merged" failure a human would read as needing a fresh look
  at the code.
