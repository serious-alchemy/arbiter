  An author that is alive when the ReviewGate starts and gone by the time the
  gate's verdict call runs — the shape of a worker that crashed (or whose node
  restarted) between the round finishing and `report/2`.

  Stops normally on the first call it receives, so the caller *exits* rather
  than getting a reply or an `{:error, _}` return. `ReviewGate.report/2` makes
  its two author calls back to back with no message processing in between, so
  the first (`Worker.report/3`) kills this process and the second
  (`Worker.review_gate_verdict/2`) deterministically exits `:noproc`.

  bd-3wumco: a ReviewGate round that converges to APPROVE *after* an earlier
  round's REQUEST_CHANGES already parked the author at `:failed`.

  Observed on vstim `vs-33ulbf`: round 1 came back "changes requested", the
  worker's run went terminal (`failure_reason: :review_gate_rejected`), and the
  revise loop then kept going on its own — round-2 and round-3 reviews both
  APPROVEd. The approval was reported back to an author already sitting at
  `:failed`, where `review_gate_verdict/2` answered
  `{:invalid_transition, :failed, :review_gate_verdict}` — an error
  `ReviewGate.report/2` discards inside `safe/1`. Net effect: the MR sat open
  with green CI and an approving review, the task stayed `failed` forever, and
  the merge handoff never happened.

  The fix reconciles forward: an APPROVE arriving at a worker whose *only*
  reason for being `:failed` is a ReviewGate rejection overturns that rejection
  and runs the normal approve path (merge / Watchdog handoff). Failures for any
  other reason are untouched, and a late REQUEST_CHANGES / no-verdict is still
  refused — reconciliation only ever moves a task forward.
