defmodule Arbiter.Worker.CommitGateTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression test for bd-ofql8k.

  Root cause the gate addresses: the worker EDITS files in its worktree
  correctly but never `git commit`s, so HEAD stays at the base branch with
  the work UNCOMMITTED in the worktree. Before this fix the ReviewGate — which
  runs in the same worktree — diffed `git diff <base>..HEAD` (committed
  history only), saw empty, and reported "no code exists" while literally
  sitting on the uncommitted changes.

  The fix gates `Worker.on_claude_done` on `Worktree.completion_state/2`:
  if the tree is dirty or has no commits ahead of the target, the worker
  either (a) relaunches the worker with a clear "you have uncommitted
  changes — commit + push" nudge, capped at `meta[:commit_nudge_cap]` (default
  1), or (b) fails + escalates with details when the cap is exhausted. The
  ReviewGate is never reached in either case, so it can never falsely report
  "no work" while the work is sitting right there.

  These tests pin the structural gate (cap: 0 → fail immediately) so the
  failure mode cannot regress. The nudge re-spawn itself is exercised
  indirectly via the cap-bookkeeping assertion.
