defmodule Arbiter.Worker.WorkspaceDestroyedTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression tests for bd-b6noq9 / #1930: a worker whose **provisioned**
  workspace is deleted out from under it mid-run must fail with a distinct,
  machine-readable `:workspace_destroyed` stop reason.

  The four escalations that produced this issue (`fp-7zn1p7`, `fp-6u0wu1`,
  `cr-ag13cz`, `fp-ry8klj`) each reached the coordinator as a differently
  worded free-text "needs human review" note, because Arbiter itself had no
  concept of the condition:

    * `commit_gate/1` gates on `File.dir?(worktree)` and **fails open** when
      the directory is gone, so a destroyed workspace routed to the review
      gate / merger exactly like a healthy completion — on a branch that no
      longer exists anywhere.
    * `:exited_without_done` is a *resumable* category, so a subprocess that
      died because its cwd vanished was auto-resumed into a directory that is
      not there.

  Both paths must now terminate at `:workspace_destroyed`, and the condition
  must stay distinct from `:missing_worktree` (bd-7pe74i), which means the
  opposite thing: a workspace that was never provisioned at all.
