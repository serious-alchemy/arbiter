So this MR's pipeline supplies zero direct evidence that the fixed image works under the `test`/`coverage` jobs' execution context.
      Findings:
      1. **Major** — `.gitlab-ci.yml:48-56` (and mirrored at `.gitlab-ci.yml:199-208` for `coverage`, which additionally `needs: test`): the `test` job's rule `changes:` list (`lib/**/*`, `test/**/*`, `mix.exs`, `mix.lock`, `config/**/*`, `priv/**/*`, `assets/**/*`, `rel/**/*`) omits `.gitlab-ci.yml`, so for an MR that only edits `.gitlab-ci.yml`/`docker-compose.yml` — exactly this MR — GitLab CI never creates the `test` or `coverage` jobs. Live confirmation: pipeline `2877022362` for HEAD `2218e545` contains only `visual` and the five `audit:*` jobs; no `test`/`coverage` job exists in the run at all.
         - Failure scenario: acceptance criterion 2 requires this MR's own pipeline to show `test`, `coverage`, and `visual` getting past 'prepare environment' and passing. Since `test`/`coverage` never start, there is no pipeline evidence — only inference from `visual`'s success — that the image pull, `MINIO_KMS_SECRET_KEY` handshake, and SSE-S3 behavior work correctly under the `test` job's 4-way `parallel` matrix or the `coverage` merge step.
         - Suggested fix: add `".gitlab-ci.yml"` to the `changes:` globs for the `test` job (`.gitlab-ci.yml:49-56`) and `coverage` job (`.gitlab-ci.yml:200-207`), mirroring what `visual`'s rule already does at `.gitlab-ci.yml:113-121`. Push that as part of this MR (or a fixup commit) so the pipeline actually exercises `test`/`coverage`, then attach their passing results as evidence before merge. This also fixes the underlying gap for any future CI-only change.
      The image-reference change itself is correct and minimal: `command`, `alias`, and the SSE/KMS variables are untouched in both `.gitlab-ci.yml` services, `docker-compose.yml` was updated identically, and I independently confirmed the pinned tag `quay.io/minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z` exists and is pullable (`docker manifest inspect` succeeded) and that the `visual` job in this MR's real pipeline pulled it and passed. The blocking issue is purely that criterion 2's required pipeline evidence for `test`/`coverage` doesn't exist yet due to a pre-existing rules gap, not a defect in the image substitution itself.
