defmodule Arbiter.Quota.GateWeeklyStalenessTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Coverage for the sticky long-window hold (bd-b7umwj).

  bd-y0yup0 made a stale snapshot fail open so a fully-held fleet could still
  get one attempt through per staleness window and re-capture a real reading.
  That recovery works for the **primary** window, where the let-through attempt
  is refused by the provider and immediately re-captures `rejected`. It is a
  hole for the **long** window, where a hold happens at `allowed_warning`:
  Anthropic still accepts the request, so the let-through dispatch *succeeds*
  and runs a worker for hours against a budget the operator asked us to stop
  spending. The observed loop on 2026-09-11:

      7d held → no worker traffic → snapshot stale after 5 min → fail open →
      Autopilot dispatches → worker runs for hours at 96% → repeat

  So staleness is now scoped per window: the primary window still fails open on
  age (bd-y0yup0 intact), while a long-window hold is sticky — only a *fresh*
  snapshot showing it cleared, or the long window's own `reset_at` rolling,
  lifts it.
