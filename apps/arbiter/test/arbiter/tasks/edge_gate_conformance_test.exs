defmodule Arbiter.Tasks.EdgeGateConformanceTest do
  @moduledoc """
  bd-6bax7s acceptance 4: every `Dependency` edge type, and what the dispatch
  path does with it.

  Each scenario builds issues and `Dependency` rows, then asks the **board
  path** — `Arbiter.Board.Snapshot` → `Arbiter.Board.Scheduler`, the one
  `Arbiter.Board.Autopilot` actually dispatches from — which cards it refuses
  to dispatch **because of an edge**, the question `Arbiter.Tasks.EdgeGate`
  owns.

  This used to compare that answer against a second scheduler (the graph
  Conductor), which is the drift bd-6bax7s was filed for. bd-a14qd1 removed
  that scheduler, so there is one path left and the table below pins its
  answer directly — the same scenarios, the same expectations.
