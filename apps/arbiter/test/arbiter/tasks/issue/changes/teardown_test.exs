  Covers the after-action hooks wired into `Arbiter.Tasks.Issue`'s `:close`

    * `StopWorker` — tear down the running worker, if any.
    * `CleanupWorktree` — remove the task's worktree, if any (and clean).

  Both must be best-effort: a missing worker or worktree is a no-op; a
  dirty worktree is preserved.
