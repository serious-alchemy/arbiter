  @moduledoc """
  The autopilot against a real board read.

  `Arbiter.Board.AutopilotTest` stubs the snapshot so it can drive one
  decision at a time; this file leaves `Snapshot.load/1` in place and only
  stubs the dispatch, so the wiring the product actually depends on — issues
  in the database → `Snapshot.load/1` → `Scheduler.plan/1` → a dispatch —
  is exercised end to end. Nothing here spawns a worker: the seam under test
  is *which* id the autopilot hands to dispatch, not what dispatch does with
  it.
