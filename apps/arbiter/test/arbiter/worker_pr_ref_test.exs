defmodule Arbiter.WorkerPrRefTest do
  @moduledoc """
  bd-7b46wd: when the worker opens its own PR/MR (the worker finished and the
  branch is integrated through the configured merger), the opened ref must be
  persisted onto the task's `pr_ref`.

  This is the single signal the workspace MergeQueue reads to ADOPT an already-open
  PR (`MergeQueue.existing_mr_ref/1`) instead of opening a duplicate. Without it
  the Watchdog-merged PR is invisible to the MergeQueue: it falls through to
  `open_mr_for/3`, fails opening a second PR on the already-merged branch, and
  the task is never auto-closed — exactly the recurring silent-stall the task
  describes.
