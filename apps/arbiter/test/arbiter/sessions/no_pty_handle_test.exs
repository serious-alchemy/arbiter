  Acceptance criterion 3 (bd-bpt0ag): **no Elixir process holds the PTY.**

  This is the property the whole design rests on (RFC §4.1/§4.3/§4.4). A
  BEAM-owned PTY master — `Port.open`, `:erlexec`, a NIF — closes when the BEAM
  exits, the slave gets `SIGHUP`, and the session dies: a coordinator that
  restarts arbiter would kill itself mid-restart. Restart survival is supposed
  to be true *by construction* here, because there is no supervision link to
  sever at all.

  "By construction" is only true as long as nobody adds a port later, so it is
  asserted rather than trusted: the session path may spawn **only** through the
  synchronous, injectable command runner, which returns before it hands control
  back.

  This is the grep AC 3 asks for, expressed as a test so it runs in CI.

  # PTY and holds no handle. Its tests verify against real fixture
