  bd-5v8f8l — the generated `CLAUDE.md` must carry the coordinator's *role*,
  not just its hazards.

  The reproduction (session 73754f39) violated no existing rule: it obeyed the
  live-checkout prohibition exactly and then implemented the fix itself in a
  legitimately-created worktree, because the prompt described worktree
  mechanics as its standing way of doing repository work and said nothing
  about filing. These assertions are the regression fence for both halves —
  the delegation rule and the research-delegation doctrine — under both
  `can_dispatch` values, since the default (`false`) is the arm where a naive
  "delegate via `worker_dispatch`" rule would render an instruction the
  session cannot execute.
