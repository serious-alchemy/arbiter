# bd-bpt0ag: `:live_systemd` tests spawn REAL systemd user scopes and tmux
# servers on whatever host runs them, so they are opt-in rather than part of
# `mix precommit`. Run them deliberately:
#
#     mix test --include live_systemd
#
# Every one of them tears down by exact unit name and exact socket path — this
# repo has an incident class around pattern-based kills reaching the live
# coordinator.
# bd-aprlbb: `:live_claude` tests start the REAL `claude` CLI interactively and
# assert it reaches a prompt with no onboarding wizard (RFC §9.2). Opt-in for
# the same reason, plus a credential one — see the test's moduledoc:
#
#     mix test --include live_claude test/integration/session_onboarding_test.exs
# bd-3ymdvi: `:tmux` tests run a real tmux server on a scratch socket in the
# test's own `tmp_dir` — no systemd, no session row, torn down by exact socket
# path. They are cheap and they are the only proof that phase 4's tmux argv is
# right on the tmux that is installed, so they run by default and are skipped
# only where tmux is absent.

# a session launched from inside it survives with no gap in its output. Same
# opt-in reason as `:live_systemd`, plus one more: GitHub Actions runners often
# have no systemd user instance at all, so it *cannot* run there.
#
# That makes silence the risk. A suite that reports green while the one
# property every other phase assumes went unchecked is worse than no test, so
# the exclusion announces itself with its reason instead of hiding in ExUnit's
# "Excluding tags:" line.
