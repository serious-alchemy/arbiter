  @moduledoc """
  Server-push event stream over a long-lived chunked HTTP connection.

  Route: GET /events?token=<coord_token>&subscribe=<comma-separated topics>&since=<cursor|timestamp>

  Auth: a coordinator-tier MCP token, either as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  or in the `token=` query parameter (checked in that order). The header form
  exists for a session's own event monitor (bd-aqafdr): a session's token
  lives only in a mode-0600 `curl -K` config, never in argv, so it is sent as
  a header rather than a query string. `token=` stays supported unchanged for
  the `arb init` runbook's `curl -N` loop, which has no header to send.

  Topics (default: inbox,review_gate,worker_failed):
    * inbox          — a message arrived in the coordinator's mailbox
    * review_gate       — a review_gate escalation requires coordinator ruling
    * worker_failed — a worker stopped unexpectedly (status → failed).
                      Carries `status` + `phase` (bd-aw2cyt).
    * worker_done   — a worker completed (status → completed).
                      Carries `status` + `phase` (bd-aw2cyt).
    * worker_phase  — a worker's phase changed (bd-aw2cyt): `implementing`,
                      `in_review`, `addressing_review`, `fixing_ci`,
                      `resolving_conflict`, `waiting_on_you`, `done`.
                      (An open PR is no worker phase: the ticket is
                      `merging`, bd-36ytcl.) Carries
                      `task_id`, `registry_key`, `role`, `status`, `phase`,
                      `phase_label` and `agent_live`. The record's `status`
                      outlives its agent — a `running` worker whose main agent
                      exited is shepherding review / CI / the merge and spends
                      no quota; `phase` is what says which. Opt-in only
                      (pass `subscribe=...,worker_phase`).
    * task_state     — any task FSM transition (noisier — opt-in only)
    * external_review — an ExternalReview lifecycle transition: running / completed /
                        failed (opt-in only — pass subscribe=...,external_review)
    * loop_proposal  — a loop-engineering proposal was recorded, reinforced,
                       promoted to `proposed`, applied or rejected (opt-in only —
                       pass subscribe=...,loop_proposal)
    * gate_cap_hit   — a gate escalated because its round / send-back budget ran
                       out (bd-4qjl0q): `task_id`, `gate`, `rounds`, `cap`
                       (opt-in only — pass subscribe=...,gate_cap_hit)
    * gate_resolved  — the coordinator recorded its answer to a gate escalation
                       (bd-4qjl0q): `task_id`, `gate`, `decision`, `actor`,
                       `round` (opt-in only — pass subscribe=...,gate_resolved)

  Wire format: one newline-terminated JSON object per event. A bare newline
  is sent every 30 seconds on idle connections as a keepalive. Every event
  carries a `"cursor"` field — an integer that only ever increases — so a
  reconnecting client can pass the highest cursor it saw back as `since=`.

  ## Replay (`since=`)

  `since` accepts either an integer cursor (a value previously seen in an
  event's `"cursor"` field) or an ISO-8601 timestamp. When present, the
  connection first replays every persisted event after that point — scoped
  to the requested topics and workspace, oldest first — before joining the
  live stream, so a client that was disconnected for N minutes and
  reconnects with `since=<last cursor>` sees the gap exactly once, in
  order, with no duplicate delivery from the live tail. See
  `Arbiter.Events.replay/3` for the persistence and ordering guarantees.
  Omitting `since` skips replay entirely (today's behavior: live events only).

  Client usage:
      curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:4848/events?token=...&subscribe=inbox,review_gate"
      curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:4848/events?token=...&since=1042"

  #
  # `watermark` is FROZEN at the replay high-water mark for the life of the
  # connection — it is never advanced by live sends. It only exists to
  # suppress events the replay query already returned (cursor <=
  # watermark), which is what makes the subscribe-before-replay race in
  # stream/2 safe: an event that arrives both via the replay query and via a
  # queued PubSub message is only ever sent once. PubSub never redelivers a
  # message, so advancing the watermark on every live send buys nothing —
  # and it actively breaks delivery for concurrent broadcasters, since two
  # events persisted close together can be broadcast out of cursor order
  # (persist and PubSub broadcast aren't atomic across processes): if a
  # higher-cursor event's PubSub message is scheduled first, advancing the
  # watermark to it would cause the lower-cursor event that follows to be
  # wrongly treated as already-delivered and silently dropped. An event with
  # no cursor (persist failed) is always sent — it was never a replay
  # candidate to begin with.
  # `revocation_deadline` is a `System.monotonic_time(:millisecond)` value:
  # the next time revocation is due to be re-checked. It is independent of
  # the receive timeout below — a stream that never idles (an event arrives
  # at least once per `keepalive_ms`) would otherwise never hit the `after`
  # clause, and a revoked/ended session's already-open stream would keep
  # streaming forever instead of closing within one keepalive interval.
