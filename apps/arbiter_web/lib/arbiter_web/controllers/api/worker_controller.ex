defmodule ArbiterWeb.Api.WorkerController do
  @moduledoc """
  REST endpoints for worker lifecycle. The arb CLI calls `dispatch/2` to
  start work on a task; future LiveView dashboards will use the same
  endpoints + `list/2` to introspect running workers.

  Routes:

    * `POST /api/workers/dispatch`           — :dispatch (body: `task_id`, optional `repo`, `provider`).
      `provider` is `"claude"` | `"gemini"` (deprecated aliases: `with_claude` /
      `with_gemini` booleans). With a provider a worker subprocess works the task
      and the Driver closes it on `arb done`; with `no_agent` the task parks in
      `:active` (no Driver).
    * `POST /api/workers/review`          — :review.
      Two shapes: (a) `task_id` (+ optional `repo`) dispatches a review-only
      worker against the PR/MR linked to a task — no worktree, no per-task
      branch, no merge-queue route, always claude-driven. (b) `pr` (URL or
      number, + optional `repo`/`workspace`) reviews an **external / non-arbiter
      PR** via the MR adapter (`Arbiter.Reviews.ExternalReview`): no task, no
      branch — findings + a verdict are posted to that PR.
    * `GET  /api/workers`                 — :index. Every ticket with a live run,
      as its current run (`Arbiter.Workers.Current.list/1`). Optional
      `workspace_id` scopes it to the tickets of one workspace — a ReviewGate
      reviewer's run included, though its worker carries no workspace itself.
    * `GET  /api/workers/:task_id`        — :show. The ticket's current run
      (full detail inc. recent output) plus its recent runs, each labelled with
      its kind (`Arbiter.Workers.Current.show/2`). The current run is read by
      the same function `:index` reads, in the same vocabulary — kind / state /
      outcome (`Arbiter.Workers.RunState`) — live or not.
    * `POST /api/workers/:task_id/resume` — :resume (bd-1z7624, #472).
      Session-level resume: re-spawns the worker continuing the task's PRIOR
      Claude session (`claude --print --resume <session_id>`) in the SAME
      preserved worktree. Refuses (pointing at `arb dispatch`) when no prior
      session/worktree exists — never silently starts fresh.
    * `POST /api/workers/:task_id/stop`   — :stop (terminate worker cleanly)
    * `GET  /api/workers/:task_id/log`    — :log (full, uncapped durable
      transcript of the task's most recent run; the audit source of record).
      `task_id` may be a ReviewGate synthetic id (`<base>#review`, `#r<N>`,
      `#impl<N>`, `#v<N>`, `#t<N>`, percent-encoded in the path). Pass
      `?run_id=` to read that exact run instead of the task's latest.
    * `GET  /api/workers/:task_id/prompt`  — :prompt (bd-9rdwe4). The composed
      prompt the run's most recent (or `?run_id=`-selected) session was spawned
      with, redacted the same way the transcript is. Sibling of `:log`.
    * `GET  /api/workers/:task_id/run_log_list` — :run_log_list. Every run
      for `task_id` plus its ReviewGate synthetic children, newest first,
      with `transcript_exists`/`line_count` (no full transcript — use
      `:log` for that).
