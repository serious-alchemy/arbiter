defmodule ArbiterWeb.SessionTranscriptController do
  @moduledoc """
  The whole of a finished session's artefacts, for the operator who wants
  more than the dock shows (bd-3tf4oo).

  The dock replays a **bounded tail** of the raw transcript
  (`Arbiter.Sessions.TranscriptReplay`) — a 100 MB file is not something to
  push into xterm. This is where the rest of it lives: `:raw` serves the
  captured PTY stream verbatim, and `:jsonl` serves the session JSONL
  `Arbiter.Worker.SessionArchive` wrote on session end, decompressed, which is
  what the dock's "transcript unavailable" state links to when the raw stream
  is gone but the archive is not, and what the issue detail page's
  "Transcript" link points at for a refine session (bd-cvfjms).

  ## Loopback only

  Both files are the session's screen and its agent transcript — redacted on
  write, but still the most sensitive bytes the dashboard can hand out. They
  are served under the same rule the terminal socket applies (§10.4,
  `ArbiterWeb.SessionSocket`): a peer on this box, or nothing. There is no
  token path here on purpose; off-box access to a session is Remote Control's
  problem (§8), and a download URL is exactly the sort of thing that gets
  pasted somewhere it should not be.
