defmodule ArbiterWeb.SessionChannel do
  @moduledoc """
  RFC §5.2's message envelope, verbatim (bd-3ymdvi, phase 4 of
  `docs/browser-hosted-coordinator-sessions.md`).

  One channel process per attached browser tab, on topic `session:<id>`. It is
  a **translation layer**: the protocol's state — sequence numbers, the replay
  ring, backpressure, geometry — lives in `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream`, and this
  module turns its messages into channel events and back. That split is what
  lets the transport be tested headlessly and lets a second transport (a CLI,
  a second UI) exist later without reimplementing the protocol.

  ## Transcript mode (bd-3tf4oo)

  A session that has *ended* has no reader to attach to, but it usually has a
  persisted raw transcript (`Arbiter.Sessions.Transcript`, §11). Joining with
  `%{"mode" => "transcript"}` replays that file instead of attaching: the
  bytes go out as the same `snapshot` event a live attach sends, so the
  browser paints a finished session through the terminal's existing repaint
  path rather than through a second renderer. The join reply carries the
  replay's bounds (`total_bytes`, `replay_bytes`, `truncated?`) and the
  session's own end reason and `ended_at`.

  Such a channel is a *reader of a file*, and everything that would make it
  look otherwise is refused with `read_only`: stdin, resize, redraw and kill.
  It starts no reader process, subscribes to no usage feed, pushes no `meta`
  and never stamps `last_client_at` — an ended session has no idle deadline
  left to postpone. A transcript that is missing (swept by
  `Arbiter.Sessions.TranscriptRetention`, never captured, or empty) refuses
  the join with `transcript_unavailable` and the reason, which the dock
  renders as an explicit empty state rather than a blank terminal.

  ## Client → server

  | Event | Payload | Notes |
  |---|---|---|
  | `join` | `%{last_seq \\| nil, cols, rows}` | session id comes from the topic |
  | `stdin` | `{:binary, frame}` | `Arbiter.Sessions.Frame`; raw bytes |
  | `resize` | `%{cols, rows}` | debounced client-side |
  | `redraw` | `%{}` | make the agent repaint; see `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream.redraw/2` |
  | `detach` | `%{}` | leave the session running; the reader is dropped |
  | `kill` | `%{confirm: true}` | via `Arbiter.Sessions.kill/2` |
  | `ping` | `%{ts}` | liveness/RTT for the HUD |

  ## Server → client

  | Event | Payload | Notes |
  |---|---|---|
  | `snapshot` | `%{seq, data}` | ANSI-preserving scrollback |
  | `stdout` | `{:binary, frame}` | live output, `seq` framed in |
  | `exit` | `%{code, reason}` | the agent exited |
  | `meta` | `%{cols, rows, attached_clients, title}` | reconciles another client's resize |
  | `usage` | `%{tokens_in, …}` | HUD feed (§7.5, phase 7) |
  | `error` | `%{code, detail}` | e.g. `session_gone`, `bridge_unavailable` |

  ## Why stdin and stdout are binary

  A terminal stream splits multi-byte UTF-8 and escape sequences across reads.
  Decoding at the transport corrupts them permanently, so neither direction is
  ever JSON-wrapped or validated as text here — `Arbiter.Sessions.Frame` puts
  `seq` in front of the bytes and nothing touches the bytes themselves.

  ## stdin sequence numbers

  Client stdin frames carry the client's own monotonic counter. A reconnecting
  client that re-sends its tail would otherwise type the same keystrokes into
  the pane twice, which for a terminal is not a cosmetic bug — it is a second
  `rm` with a second newline. Anything at or below the highest seq already
  seen on **this** channel is dropped. The counter is per channel process, so
  a genuinely new connection starting again at 1 is not affected.

  ## Join ordering

  A client may rely on the first thing it receives after a successful `join`
  being its `snapshot` (or its replay frames) — never a live `stdout`. The
  reader starts streaming to this pid during the attach call, so frames can
  land before the join flush runs; they are held and delivered in order
  afterwards rather than jumping the queue. Without that, a client would have
  to repaint backwards over bytes it had already drawn.

  ## Geometry

  `cols`/`rows` are only honoured when both are positive integers. Anything
  else — absent, non-integer, or the `0` a browser reports for a terminal it
  has not laid out yet — means "no opinion", and the pane keeps its size.

  ## Backpressure

  Every pushed frame is acknowledged back to the reader
  (`Arbiter.Sessions.Stream.ack/3`) so a client the socket cannot keep up with
  stops receiving frames and is repainted with one snapshot when it recovers,
  rather than growing an unbounded mailbox (§5.3 item 2).
