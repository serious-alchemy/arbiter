  @moduledoc """
  The **Return to Backlog** (demote) action, shared by the board's Ready cards
  and the task detail page (bd-a1bmyx).

  Both surfaces call the same underlying `return_to_backlog` action through here
  for consistency.

  ## The button nests inside a clickable card, deliberately

  On the board, the Demote button sits inside a card whose own `phx-click`
  navigates to the issue. That is safe without any `stopPropagation`: LiveView
  binds clicks once on `window` and resolves the target with
  `closestPhxBinding/2`, so the **nearest** `phx-click` ancestor wins and the
  card's navigation never fires for a click on the button.
