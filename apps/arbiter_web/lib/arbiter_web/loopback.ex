defmodule ArbiterWeb.Loopback do
  @moduledoc """
  Is this peer on the box? Loopback is *not* a dashboard identity (bd-3gycsz:
  `tailscale serve` proxies from 127.0.0.1; see `ArbiterWeb.DashboardAuth`), but
  it still gates the terminal and is half of the Tailscale-header trust check.

  Arbiter binds directly to `127.0.0.1:4848` by default, with no reverse proxy
  in front, so `conn.remote_ip` / `peer_data.address` is always the real peer
  and `X-Forwarded-For` is never to be trusted. An operator can override the
  bind address with `ARB_BIND_ADDRESS` (`ArbiterWeb.Boot.BindAddressCheck`
  logs a boot WARNING when that override isn't loopback, since every
  unauthenticated LiveView page becomes reachable by anyone who can reach the
  port). The worker-session terminal stays gated by this module's
  `loopback?/1` regardless of the bind address, so it is the one page that
  does *not* become reachable off-loopback. Loopback covers the three shapes
  a same-box peer actually arrives as:

    * IPv4 `127.0.0.0/8`
    * IPv6 `::1`
    * IPv4-mapped IPv6 `::ffff:127.x.x.x`, which is what a dual-stack listener
      reports for an IPv4 client

  Extracted from `ArbiterWeb.Plugs.ApiAuth` when the session socket
  (bd-3ymdvi, RFC §10.4 "loopback only") needed the same rule: a WebSocket
  upgrade has a `peer_data`, not a `Plug.Conn`, and two copies of an
  address-range check is exactly the sort of duplication that drifts.
