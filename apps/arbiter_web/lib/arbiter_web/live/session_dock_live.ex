defmodule ArbiterWeb.SessionDockLive do
  @moduledoc """
  The session dock: a strip pinned to the bottom of every dashboard page, with
  a roster that expands into the session list and a collapsed title bar per
  opened session (bd-dlc136, phase 1 of the session dock epic).

  ## The terminal (phase 2, bd-9myzv8)

  **The expanded window holds the one live xterm and the one `/session`
  socket.** There is no per-window terminal: the pane is rendered only for
  whichever window is expanded, and "one expanded at a time" is already a
  server-side invariant, so "at most one xterm and one socket" falls out of
  the markup rather than out of bookkeeping. Collapsing removes the element,
  LiveView calls the hook's `destroyed()`, and that disposes both.

  Expanding builds a *fresh* xterm, so the resume point cannot live in it. It
  lives in `assets/js/session_dock.mjs`'s in-memory resume book, keyed by
  session id, and the join carries it as `last_seq` — which is why a window
  that was collapsed for ten minutes replays what it missed instead of
  re-snapshotting.

  §10.4 / bd-2zskbb applies here too, and now on every page rather than only
  on `/sessions/:id`: `ArbiterWeb.SessionSocket` trusts a loopback peer and the
  browser sends no token, so off loopback the window says so instead of
  mounting a pane that silently never attaches. The answer is handed in as a
  `live_render(..., session:)` value from `layouts/live.html.heex`, because
  `get_connect_info/2` is root-and-mount only and this is a nested child.

  ## The controls, and the page that used to hold them (phase 3, bd-a292yj)

  The dock is now the session. `keep_alive`, Detach, Kill, the metadata and the
  cost figure all live in a window's title bar or its overflow, and
  `/sessions/:id` — which used to own them — is **gone**, route and all. That
  was phase 3's one decision to execute: keeping the page meant two surfaces
  owning the same controls, and two surfaces that own the same control drift.
  `/sessions` stays as the index (name at launch, the whole history, and Kill
  as a fleet act). Two controls are deliberately on both surfaces: Kill, which
  goes through `SessionIndexLive.kill_modal/1` on both so there is a single
  confirmation rather than two that can diverge, and — since phase 4,
  bd-cdut29 — launch itself, through `SessionIndexLive.launch_form/1` and
  `launch_defaults/1`, so starting a session from the dock is the same one
  implementation `/sessions`' own launch button calls, not a second launcher.

  Kill keeps its confirm step *here in particular*. A title bar that is on
  screen on every page is a different risk profile from a page an operator
  navigated to deliberately; a cursor crosses this strip all day.

  Detach is not a second implementation of anything: dropping this browser's
  reader and leaving the agent running is exactly what collapsing already does
  (the pane goes, so the xterm and its socket go), so the menu item routes
  straight into `collapse`.

  ## Windows whose session has ended

  An ended session's window **stays, read-only, with its final scrollback and
  the end reason**, until the operator dismisses it. The last output is most
  interesting exactly when the session dies, and auto-closing throws it away.
  So the pane is not unmounted on an end — unmounting is what disposes the
  xterm — it is *frozen*: `data-readonly` reaches the `phx-update="ignore"`
  element (LiveView merges `data-*` onto ignored nodes and then runs the hook's
  `updated()`), the hook calls the terminal's `setReadOnly`, and the stream had
  already refused stdin from the moment the channel reported `exit`. A frozen
  window keeps its pane through a collapse too, hidden rather than removed —
  "until dismissed" means what it says. It holds no socket, so eight of them
  cost eight xterms and zero connections.

  A **LiveView rejoin** is the one thing a frozen pane cannot ride out on its
  own: a rejoin re-runs `mount/3`, renders the dock empty, and that patch
  destroys every window element and every xterm in one before `restore` puts
  them back. A live pane recovers from that by replaying its stream from
  `last_seq`; a dead one has no stream left. So the client keeps both halves —
  which sessions are frozen and the text their pane held — in
  `assets/js/session_dock.mjs`, alongside the resume book and for the same
  reason (in memory, never `localStorage`: after a full reload there is no
  window to restore into, and "this ended before this browser session" is then
  the true answer). `restore` carries the frozen list and re-validates it like
  everything else in that payload, and a pane rebuilt frozen opens no socket at
  all — it is painted from the kept text and says the styling is gone.

  ## Windows whose session ended before this browser session (bd-3tf4oo)

  A frozen pane is scrollback this browser still holds. A session that ended in
  a *previous* browser session has none — and used to get an empty panel for it
  (#1818). It now gets the **persisted transcript**: phase 9's raw capture
  (`Arbiter.Sessions.Transcript`) replayed into the same xterm, read-only.

  The replay is not a second viewer. `assign_transcript/1` asks
  `Arbiter.Sessions.TranscriptReplay` whether there is a file; if there is, the
  window mounts the *same* `.SessionTerminal` hook with `data-transcript`, the
  hook builds the *same* `SessionStream` with `mode: "transcript"`, and the
  server replays the file's tail as the *same* `snapshot` event a live attach
  sends (`ArbiterWeb.SessionChannel`). One channel, one renderer, one repaint
  path; what differs is the join params and that the stream hangs up once the
  bytes are on screen.

  Three things keep it honest:

    * It is never live. No status strip is rendered for it (that strip is the
      live HUD), the pane is read-only from its first frame, the channel
      refuses stdin/resize/redraw/kill with `read_only`, and the client does
      not reconnect — an ended session has nothing to reconnect to.
    * It says what it is showing. A transcript over
      `TranscriptReplay.max_bytes/0` is replayed as a tail, and the window's
      chrome says "showing last N of M" and links the whole file
      (`ArbiterWeb.SessionTranscriptController`). Note the replayed bytes were
      laid out by the pane at *its* geometry, not this window's, which is the
      other reason the chrome says "transcript" rather than passing it off as a
      live screen.
    * When there is nothing to replay it says which nothing it is:
      `retention_deleted`, `never_captured`, `empty`, or `loopback_only` — and
      links the archived session JSONL when one exists. Never a blank terminal.

  A frozen pane still wins over a replay while it exists: it holds the real
  screen, styling and all, and the file holds the same bytes.

  Nothing about the transport changed. `ArbiterWeb.SessionSocket`'s topic was
  already keyed to the session id rather than to a LiveView process
  (`endpoint.ex:18-26`), precisely so a client can reattach from somewhere
  else; a dock window is exactly that case.

  ## Why this is a LiveView and not a component

  It is rendered once, from `layouts/live.html.heex`, as
  `live_render(@socket, __MODULE__, id: "session-dock", sticky: true)`. Sticky
  is the whole mechanism: on a `live_redirect` within `live_session :default`
  the client moves this element into the incoming main container rather than
  re-rendering it, so the dock keeps its process, its DOM node, its hooks and
  its scroll position across navigation.

  A sticky child is a separate process with its own mount and **does not see
  the parent's assigns**, and the `live_session`'s `on_mount` hooks do not run
  for it (a nested render carries only the module's own lifecycle). So it
  reads sessions itself and subscribes to `Arbiter.Sessions.lifecycle_topic/0`
  itself. It still keeps a catch-all `handle_info/2`, because the topics it
  subscribes to are shared.

  ## Where the open/expanded state lives

  Which sessions are open, in what order, and which one is expanded is a
  *browser* preference, not fleet state: the dashboard is loopback-only and
  single-operator (§10.4), so there is no user record to hang it on and no
  cross-device case to serve. It lives in `localStorage`, owned by the
  `SessionDock` hook in `assets/js/session_dock.mjs`, which pushes it back up
  on mount and writes it whenever the server says it changed.

  Every read is treated as hostile: storage can be empty, disabled, full, or
  hold whatever a previous version of this code (or a person with a devtools
  console) left there. `handle_event("restore", ...)` therefore re-validates
  the payload against the sessions that actually exist and drops the rest,
  and the hook's own read/write are wrapped. An unreadable store renders an
  empty dock, never a broken page.

        <%!-- The status strip is chrome, pinned outside the xterm element so
              it can never fight the fit for rows (§6.3). Its contents are
              hook-owned — so LiveView is told to keep out of them, and so it
              is only rendered when there is a hook to own it. A frozen pane
              has no channel and no live state to paint, so it gets the ended
              banner below instead.

              `phx-update="ignore"` protects the *children* and nothing else:
              for an ignored node LiveView merges the server's `data-*` on and
              **removes every one the server did not render**. `data-state` is
              written here by the terminal hook and by nothing on the server,
              so without `ignore_attributes` any patch that reaches this window
              silently erases it — a live terminal whose strip claims no state
              at all, and whose `data-state` seam (`verify_session_dock_*.mjs`,
              and anything reading it) goes blind. bd-covojz found this the
              hard way: adding a size-derived class to the window turned a
              previously-empty diff into a patch, and the state vanished two
              milliseconds after it first read "live". The hook cannot put it
              back itself — `updated()` fires only when an element's own
              dataset differs from the server's, which for the *pane* it is
