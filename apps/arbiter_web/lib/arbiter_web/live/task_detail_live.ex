defmodule ArbiterWeb.TaskDetailLive do
  @moduledoc """
  Per-task detail view at `/tasks/:id` — combines the resource record,
  any active worker, dependency edges, and recent audit-log versions
  into one page. Re-renders on `:task_lifecycle` and `:worker_lifecycle`
  events so the page stays current.

  Nothing loads in `mount/3` (bd-dhghus): the dead render draws a loading
  state, the connected mount loads the header (issue, workspace, worker) via
  `start_async/3`, and its arrival starts one async load per secondary panel,
  each with its own skeleton and inline error + Retry. See "async load" below.

  Four operator actions live here — three behind their own hand-rolled modal
  (the `WorkspaceDetailLive` pattern), one a bare button — all writing through
  the same domain calls the CLI/MCP use:

    * **Edit** — the fields an operator authors: title, priority,
      difficulty, type, target branch, description and acceptance. The
      lifecycle `state` is not a form field: it moves only through the named
      transitions (Move to Ready, Return to Backlog, Dispatch, Close, ...).
      Deliberately NOT editable here: `notes` /
      `qa_notes` / `deployment_notes` / `pr_body` (worker-authored
      deliverables — a stray dashboard edit would clobber a run's output),
      and the tracker/PR linkage fields (`tracker_ref`, `pr_ref`,
      `source_pr`), which are owned by the tracker and merge-queue
      machinery. Those stay `arb update` territory.
    * **Close** — the `:close` action, with an optional reason.
    * **Dispatch** — `Arbiter.Worker.Dispatch.dispatch/2`, offered only when
      no worker is attached and the ticket is not closed. It spends real API
      credits, so the modal requires an explicit acknowledgement checkbox
      before the server will call dispatch at all. Dispatch runs in
      `start_async/3`, not inline: it shells out to the provider CLI for the
      auth preflight, gates on quota, provisions a worktree and spawns the
      agent, which is far too long to hold the LiveView process for.
    * **Move to Ready** — the `:promote_to_ready` action (bd-b5wyjd), offered
      only while the ticket is `:backlog`. It moves the ticket to `:queued`
      and does nothing else: the card leaves the board's Backlog column and
      joins the Ready queue on the queue's own terms. **Return to Backlog**
      (`:return_to_backlog`) is its inverse, offered while the ticket is
      `:queued`.

  ## Why promotion has no modal for the common case, and one gate

  The other three actions each destroy or spend something, so each asks first.
  Promotion spends nothing, and Ready is not a commitment — the scheduler still
  decides on the merits. So the common case is one click, and no confirmation
  is one fewer reason to leave work in Backlog. Return to Backlog is the one
  way back, and it refuses a ticket with a live worker.

  Description and most other fields are deliberately *not* gated on being
  filled in — Backlog is a refinement surface, not a completeness checklist,
  and the operator reading the ticket is a better judge of "refined enough"
  than a field count.

  Acceptance criteria are the one exception (bd-7mbrlg): the follow-up-rate
  investigation found most issues carry none, which leaves ReviewGate's
  criteria guards with nothing to score. A `bug`/`feature`/`chore` with blank
  `acceptance` is refused by `:promote_to_ready` unless a waiver reason is
  given — `task`/`decision`/`epic` are exempt, and D0 (trivial) work is
  auto-waived. The plain click still handles every case that doesn't need a
  waiver; only a refusal opens the waiver modal below.

  # The add modal is phrased as a sentence *from this issue's point of view*
  # (design bd-dgh2xv §3.3): the operator picks "is blocked by", not
  # `(from, type, to)`. Each phrase carries everything needed to turn that
  # sentence back into an edge:
  #
  #   * `:type`   — the `Dependency` type written. Note that **both** blocking
  #     phrasings write `:depends_on` (§2.7): `:blocks` is its exact inverse
  #     and two ways to write one fact is how operators produce contradictory
  #     duplicates. Pre-existing `:blocks` rows still render and still remove.
  #   * `:invert` — false means `from` is this issue, true means `from` is the
  #     target. That is the whole from/to convention, stated once, here.
  #   * `:group`  — the `Dependencies.for_issue/1` group this phrase's edges
  #     land in, which is what the duplicate pre-check consults.
