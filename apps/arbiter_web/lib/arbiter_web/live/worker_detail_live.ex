defmodule ArbiterWeb.WorkerDetailLive do
  @moduledoc """
  Per-worker detail view at `/workers/:task_id`. The richest single
  view of a worker: snapshot, captured Claude stdout (a sticky-bottom
  LogStream), the paired workflow Machine's step progress, the
  task's workspace context, and a Stop/Resume action.

  Subscribes to:
    * `"workers"`          — lifecycle events (started / stopped).
    * `"worker:<task-id>"`  — per-line stdout events.
    * `"messages:<ws_id>"`   — `{:new_message, _}` so the mailbox panel
                               updates live when direction/flags arrive.
