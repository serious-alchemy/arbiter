  Shared form plumbing for the dashboard's issue create/edit forms
  (`TaskIndexLive` create, `TaskDetailLive` edit).

  Both forms post plain string params and write through the `Issue` `:create` /
  `:update` actions, so the same three concerns recur: option lists for the
  enum-ish selects, coercing `""` back to `nil`, and flattening an Ash error
  into one line for the inline error slot. They live here rather than being
  copy-pasted so the two forms can't drift apart.
