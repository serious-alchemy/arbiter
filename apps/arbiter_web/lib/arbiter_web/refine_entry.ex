defmodule ArbiterWeb.RefineEntry do
  @moduledoc """
  The **Refine** action, shared by the two surfaces that offer it: the issue
  detail page's toolbar and the board's Backlog cards (bd-1lszsc).

  Both do exactly one thing — `Arbiter.Sessions.Refine.open/2`, then ask the
  dock to put the result on screen — so both do it through here rather than
  twice. A second implementation of "launch or reopen" is a second chance to
  get the "never two sessions for one issue" half wrong.

  ## Why the dock is reached by broadcast

  The dock is a sticky nested LiveView with its own process; a page holds no
  reference to it and `send_update/2` is for LiveComponents. So `open/2` calls
  `Arbiter.Sessions.request_open/1`, which the dock is already listening for.
  See that function's docs for why a broadcast is the right shape on a
  loopback, single-operator dashboard.

  ## The button nests inside a clickable card, deliberately

  On the board, the Refine button sits inside a card whose own `phx-click`
  navigates to the issue. That is safe without any `stopPropagation`: LiveView
  binds clicks once on `window` and resolves the target with
  `closestPhxBinding/2`, so the **nearest** `phx-click` ancestor wins and the
  card's navigation never fires for a click on the button.
