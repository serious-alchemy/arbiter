defmodule ArbiterWeb.SessionTransportSocketTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The terminal transport over a **real WebSocket**, driven by the same client
  the coordinator will run for acceptance criterion 8 (bd-3ymdvi).

  ## Why this exists on top of the other two channel test files

  `ArbiterWeb.SessionChannelTest` uses `Phoenix.ChannelTest`, which installs a
  no-op serializer and hands payloads to the test as Elixir terms — it proves
  the channel *pushes* `{:binary, frame}`, not that a browser receives those
  bytes. `ArbiterWeb.SessionWireFormatTest` closes half of that gap by running
  the production `Phoenix.Socket.V2.JSONSerializer` in both directions, but
  still never crosses a socket.

  This file crosses one: Bandit on a real port, a real WebSocket upgrade, the
  real `phoenix.js` the dashboard ships, and `scripts/verify_session_transport.mjs`
  doing the `seq` arithmetic. Nothing here is a stand-in except the pane.

  ## What it is for

  Criterion 8 is post-merge and coordinator-owned — it needs a running arbiter
  to `systemctl --user restart`, and phase 5's browser terminal does not exist
  yet, so the coordinator will point that script at the live host instead. What
  is reachable pre-merge is proving the *script* is right: that it decodes the
  `ARB1` frames, that its rejoin carries the newest `last_seq` rather than the
  one it first connected with (a real phoenix.js trap — join params are only
  re-evaluated when they are a closure), and that its gap/duplicate arithmetic
  reports `PASS` on a genuinely gapless resume and not by default.

  So the restart is simulated the way the real one behaves: the listener goes
  away *and* the reader (`Arbiter.Sessions.Stream`) is stopped, output keeps
  accumulating in the pipe file while both are down — which is what really
  happens, because the `cat` tmux spawned lives in the session's own systemd
  scope, not in the BEAM — and then both come back. If the script says `PASS`
  here, a `PASS` on the live host means what it claims.
