defmodule ArbiterWeb.SessionStreamNodeTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Runs the browser terminal's JavaScript unit tests as part of `mix test`
  (bd-c76fu9, phase 5 acceptance criteria 2 and 3).

  `assets/js/session_stream.mjs` owns the resume protocol the terminal hook
  depends on — the `last_seq` rejoin closure, duplicate suppression after a
  reconnect, binary stdin framing, the debounced resize — and `session_fit.mjs`
  and `session_keys.mjs` own the pane's geometry and its copy/paste policy
  (bd-3r2otb), and `session_geometry.mjs` owns which of two browser clients
  attached to one pane gets to resize it (bd-4tjw34). A JS test suite that
  only runs when somebody remembers to type `node --test` is a suite that
  stops running, so this shells out to it and fails the Elixir build with its
  transcript attached.

  No npm: `node:test` and `node:assert` are built in (RFC §6.1), which is the
  same bargain `ArbiterWeb.SessionTransportSocketTest` already makes.
