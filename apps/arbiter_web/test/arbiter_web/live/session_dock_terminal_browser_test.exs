defmodule ArbiterWeb.SessionDockTerminalBrowserTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The session dock's terminal, end to end (bd-9myzv8, phase 2 of the session
  dock epic).

  `ArbiterWeb.SessionDockLiveTest` proves everything the server decides: that
  the expanded window renders the hook, that the collapsed ones do not, and
  that exactly one pane exists across a full strip. Every remaining acceptance
  criterion is a claim about the *client*, and `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` has no
  client, no xterm and no second socket to lose:

    * expanding connects to `/session` and resumes from the last seen
      `last_seq`, so output produced while the window was collapsed appears
      with nothing lost and nothing duplicated;
    * collapsing disposes the xterm and closes the socket, so a strip of
      collapsed windows holds zero of each — asserted from *both* ends, the
      browser counting `.xterm` nodes and this process counting the readers
      actually attached;
    * at most one xterm and one `/session` connection exists whatever the
      number of open windows;
    * navigating between pages keeps the terminal connected and correctly laid
      out, with no repaint — the epic's headline behaviour;
    * the geometry is right on expand, after a browser resize, and after the
      re-parent a live navigation puts the sticky dock through;
    * `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Escape` hands the keyboard back to the page;
    * a LiveView rejoin — a server restart, §10.1's whole point — comes back
      to a live, fitted terminal rather than an empty strip.

  ## The handshake

  Producing output *while a window is collapsed* is the one thing neither side
  can do alone: the browser has no terminal to type into, and this process
  cannot see the strip. So `scripts/verify_session_dock_terminal.mjs` and the
  `Task` below take turns over two files in `tmp_dir` — the script writes
  `req` as `<n> <command>`, this side answers in `ack` as `<n> <result>`.
  `subscribers` is answered from `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream.stats/1`, which is
  how "zero live sockets" is checked against the server rather than inferred
  from the DOM.

  The pane is `Arbiter.Test.ScriptedPty`, so `emit` appends raw bytes to the
  same pipe file tmux's `pipe-pane` writes: the reader, the framing, the ring
  and the resume arithmetic are all the real ones.

  Skipped, not failed, where there is no Chromium (the script exits `3`) or no
  esbuild/tailwind binary to build the bundle with.
