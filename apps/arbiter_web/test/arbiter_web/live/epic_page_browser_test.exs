defmodule ArbiterWeb.EpicPageBrowserTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The `/epics` page in a real browser at a real narrow width (bd-2wmxt5,
  acceptance criterion 6).

  `ArbiterWeb.EpicIndexLiveTest` proves the page's *data* — the right epics,
  the right buckets, the right chips, live on PubSub. What it cannot prove is
  "usable at ~400px width, with rows stacked": `ConnCase` has no layout engine,
  so the closest it can get is asserting that a row carries `flex-col
  sm:flex-row`, which is a claim about an attribute rather than about where the
  browser actually puts the two halves of the row. A stray `min-w-[...]`, a
  title that forgets to truncate, or a progress bar with no flexible width all
  leave those classes exactly where they are and still push the row past the
  viewport.

  So this boots the real endpoint on a real port, seeds an epic with children
  in every bucket and a blocked one for good measure, and measures the rendered
  row at 1280px and at 400px: side-by-side above the breakpoint, stacked below
  it, nothing overflowing, and every piece of it still drawn.

  The page is served from the real bundle, so the bundle has to be current —
  rebuilt here by calling `Esbuild.run/2` and `Tailwind.run/2` directly, never
  by shelling out to `mix`, which would deadlock on the build lock the
  surrounding `mix test` already holds. The CSS is not optional: the stacking
  under test *is* a Tailwind class.

  Skipped, not failed, where there is no Chromium (the script exits `3`) or no
  esbuild/tailwind binary to build the bundle with.
