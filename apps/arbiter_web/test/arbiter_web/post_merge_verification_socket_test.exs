defmodule ArbiterWeb.PostMergeVerificationSocketTest do
  @moduledoc """
  bd-9so315, acceptance criterion 6 — the post-merge verification loop observed
  over a **real HTTP listener**, not `Phoenix.ConnTest`.

  ## Status of criterion 6 — settled, and what is still owed

  Criterion 6 asks for a restart-and-observe against a running server. The
  production coordinator cannot supply it (it runs pre-migration `main`, and
  restarting it tears down every in-flight worker), and this worker is
  forbidden from booting a server process of its own.

  That impasse was ruled on rather than argued: the **coordinator decision of
  2026-09-13 22:40Z**, recorded in `bd-9so315`'s task notes, re-specified
  criterion 6 as **post-merge and coordinator-owned — not a merge gate** (a
  restart-and-observe can only happen after the merge and the restart, so no
  pre-merge session can produce it), and accepted **this test as the pre-merge
  evidence** for it. Criteria 1-5 gate the merge; this file is what stands in
  for 6 until the deploy.

  So this test does not *satisfy* criterion 6, and is not claimed to. What is
  still owed, after this branch merges and the coordinator restarts (boot
  applies migration `20260913120000`), is the 5-step protocol written out in
  `bd-9so315`'s notes: flag a trivial live task, merge it, confirm it parks at
  `awaiting_verification` with one escalation and an age in `arb prime`, close
  it with `arb ticket verify <id> --observed "…"`, and record the observation on
  the task. That observation IS criterion 6; nothing here replaces it.

  ## What this test does cover

  What is reachable pre-merge, and what this test does, is to stand the real
  endpoint up on a real socket inside the test VM and drive the whole loop
  across it:

    1. a `verify_after_deploy` task is created by `POST /api/issues` over TCP —
       the exact wire request `arb ticket create --verify-after-deploy` sends;
    2. the real `Arbiter.Workflows.MergeQueue` GenServer merges its PR;
    3. `GET /api/issues/:id` over TCP reports `awaiting_verification`, and the
       coordinator has exactly one escalation naming the boot-vs-merge question;
    4. `POST /api/issues/:id/verify` over TCP — byte-for-byte the request
       `ArbiterCli.Cmd.Verify` builds (`%{"outcome" => _, "evidence" => _}`,
       asserted on the wire in `ArbiterCli.Cmd.VerifyTest`) — closes the task;
    5. a fresh `GET` confirms the evidence is durable, not just echoed.

  Unlike the `ConnCase` coverage, every step here crosses a socket into a
  separate request process: Bandit, the endpoint plug pipeline, JSON
  encode/decode and the DB checkout all run for real. The test prints a
  transcript so the run can be pasted as the recorded observation.
