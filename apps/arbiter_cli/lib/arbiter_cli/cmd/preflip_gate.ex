defmodule ArbiterCli.Cmd.PreflipGate do
  @moduledoc """
  `arb preflip-gate` — is §6.3's rollout gate clear to flip
  `merge.coverage_enabled`?

  Runs `Arbiter.Reviews.CoverageShadow.preflip_gate/0` against the running
  install's own database (bd-cy2mmu: previously this function had no caller
  outside its own tests — the operator had to hand-run it via `iex -S mix`).

  Reports the merge count, disagreements broken down by `old->new` transition
  (blocking vs. the one documented `covered->uncovered` fix_pass exception —
  see `Arbiter.Reviews.CoverageShadow.deferred_reasons/0`), and the pass/fail
  verdict with its reason.

  A "merge" is one distinct durable `coverage_shadow` observation (deduped by
  `{site, mr_ref, head, old, new}` at write time) where the old guard both
  merged (`old = "covered"`) and was still authoritative.

  The gate itself does not filter by a fix-boundary timestamp — it reads the
  whole topic — so every listed disagreement carries `occurred_at`. That is
  how an operator sees whether blocking disagreements predate a since-landed
  fix rather than waiting on `Arbiter.Events.Retention` to age the old rows
  out.

  Usage:

      arb preflip-gate [--json]

  Reads from `GET /api/coverage_shadow/preflip_gate`.
