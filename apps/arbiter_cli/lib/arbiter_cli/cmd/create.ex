                       [--parent <parent-id>] [--ticket-only]`

  Creates a new issue in the resolved workspace (see `ArbiterCli.Workspace`).

  ## --difficulty N (0..5 / D0..D5)

  Sets how hard the task is. Orthogonal to `--priority`: priority answers
  "how urgent?"; difficulty answers "how hard?" and drives the model +
  thinking budget routed to workers that work the task. Classify by the
  MAX over: scope (files/modules touched), design uncertainty, reasoning
  depth (mechanical vs concurrency/correctness), blast radius, breadth of
  context required.

      D0 Trivial  — single-file, fully specified, no judgment
                    (typo, rename, config bump, doc edit).
      D1 Simple   — localized, clear approach, light reasoning;
                    follows an existing pattern.
      D2 Moderate — multi-file or some design choice; the common
                    feature case. **Default when unspecified.**
      D3 Hard     — cross-cutting, non-obvious design,
                    concurrency/state/edge-case correctness,
                    several components.
      D4 Extreme  — novel architecture, deep ambiguity,
                    correctness-critical; may warrant exploration
                    or multiple passes.
      D5 Flagship — a deliberate escalation, never an ordinary rating.
                    Work judged worth a full quota window on the
                    flagship model. Reach for it only when D4's
                    premium model at max effort has already failed
                    or is plainly inadequate — "harder than D4" is
                    not a reason. Set by the operator, by hand.

  The coordinator / filing session sets `--difficulty` at create time with a
  one-line justification in the task's description. Routing maps the value
  to abstract `{model_tier, thinking}` (see `Arbiter.Agents.Routing.ByDifficulty`).

  ## --type T (bd-9s9dqz)

  One of `task | research | bug | feature | epic | chore | decision`
  (default `feature`). `bug` / `feature` / `chore` are the code types: the
  worker commits, a PR is opened, ReviewGate engages. `research` and `task`
  are the two no-PR types — no worktree, commit gate, ReviewGate or merge —
  and NEITHER may be used for code work:

      research — an investigation; the worker must write its findings to
                 `notes` before it can complete.
      task     — a plain operational action (a restart, a config flip);
                 completes when the worker reports it done, with a short
                 outcome note. No findings required.

  ## --repo owner/name — required, but usually defaulted (bd-9dwbvt)

  Every issue now carries a repo from the moment it is created. `--repo`
  names one of the workspace's configured `repo_paths` keys; when you omit
  it, the server resolves one for you:

      explicit --repo  →  the workspace's only repo  →  its `default_repo`

  So in a single-repo workspace, or a multi-repo one with a `default_repo`
  set, you never have to pass it. In a multi-repo workspace with no
  `default_repo`, creation is **refused** with an error listing the
  configured repo keys — pass one of them, or set `default_repo` on the
  workspace (`arb config set default_repo <key> [--workspace W]`). A `--repo` that
  is not a configured key is rejected outright rather than persisted for
  dispatch to fail on later.

  An explicit `arb dispatch <id> <repo>` still overrides the issue's repo for
  that one run.

  `--parent <parent-id>` attaches the new issue as a child of an existing parent
  task immediately after creation, by adding a `parent_of` dependency edge
  (`<parent-id> parent_of <new-id>`). The parent then rolls up child progress
  and can auto-close. Like `--deps`, the task is durable even if the attach
  fails — the failure is surfaced and arb exits non-zero.

  If that parent is linked to a tracker ticket, the child does **not** mint its
  own by default (#1973): it stays local with the parent's ticket as read-only
  context (`tracker_context_ref`), so its branch and PR title still carry the
  parent's key. The workspace's `tracker.child_policy` governs this
  (`context_only` default, `inherit_parent`, `mint`).

  When the workspace has a tracker configured (`config["tracker"]["type"] !=
  none`), the server **also creates a corresponding upstream issue** and
  writes the returned ref back into `tracker_ref`. To opt out of that:

    * `--tracker-ref REF` — bind the new task to an *existing* upstream
      issue (skip outbound create). The ref is passed through to the create
      action as `tracker_ref`; the server's after-transaction hook sees the
      ref is already set and skips the API call.
    * `--no-tracker` / `--local-only` — create a purely local task even on a
      tracker-configured workspace. Forwards `skip_upstream_create=true` as
      the action argument.
    * `--ticket-only` / `--no-task` / `--unclaimed` — create ONLY the upstream
      tracker ticket, with NO local task. The ticket sits unclaimed on the
      shared tracker; anyone can pick it up via `arb claim <ref>`. The workspace
      must have a tracker configured. Mutually exclusive with `--no-tracker` /
      `--local-only` (opposite intent).
      Honored: `--title`, `--description`, `--priority`, `--type`.
      Not honored (warning emitted): `--difficulty`, `--deps`, `--parent`,
      `--tracker-ref`, `--target-branch`, `--repo`, `--labels`, `--assignee`
      (deprecated — bd-1ozks5).

  `--deps id1,id2` is a convenience that creates `blocks` dependencies for
  each listed issue (each becomes `<dep_id> blocks <new_id>`) AFTER the issue
  itself is created. If any dependency creation fails the new issue is left
  in place — the failure is reported and arb exits non-zero. Mirrors the
  upstream-create failure semantics: the task is durable, the failure is
  surfaced.

  ### Edge validation and the atomicity gap (bd-apj0gq)

  `--deps` and `--parent` POST to `/api/dependencies`, which now goes through
  `Arbiter.Tasks.Dependencies` — so an edge into another workspace, or one that
  would close a `depends_on`/`blocks` cycle, is refused, and the server's
  message (naming the two workspaces, or the cycle) is what arb prints.

  **Creation is still not atomic**: `arb create --deps/--parent` is one HTTP
  call for the issue and one per edge, so a rejected edge leaves the task
  created with the edge missing (arb says so and exits non-zero; re-run
  `arb dep add` once the conflict is resolved). This is a deliberate remaining
  gap, not an oversight — the CLI is a plain HTTP client and cannot call the
  facade in-process, and closing it properly means teaching `POST /api/issues`
  to accept edges so the issue and its edges share one transaction. It is
  benign for scheduling: `state` is not in `Issue`'s `:create` accept list,
  so a newly created task lands in Backlog and cannot be dispatched in the
  window before its edges land.

  `--labels` is accepted for interface parity with `bd` but the current Issue
  resource has no `labels` field; the value is reported back in a warning
  unless `--json` is set. The `labels` field is not yet part of the Issue resource.

  `--assignee` is deprecated (bd-1ozks5): Arbiter is a local single-user app
  and no longer tracks an assignee locally, so the flag is accepted and
  ignored with a stderr warning (unless `--json` is set) rather than
  rejected outright — for one release, so an existing script that still
  passes it doesn't break.
