                                                   Watchdog died, from the

                                                   (bd-5mzzww)
      arb queue mark-ci-external <task-id> <note>
                                               — record an "infra, not this
                                                   diff" verdict on a
                                                   :ci_failed park (bd-5mzzww)

  `retry-auto-resolve` is the supported way to force a fresh fix-pass once the
  Watchdog's bounded auto-resolve retries are exhausted: without it, a task
  parked on a genuine `:ci_failed` block after exhaustion had no way to try
  again short of pushing a fix to the branch by hand, outside Arbiter's normal
  worker/review flow. `retry_auto_resolve` (underscored) is accepted as an
  undocumented alias for back-compat.

  `restart-watchdog` recovers the *other* failure: a Watchdog is a `:temporary`
  process, so when it crashes it is gone for good and nothing announces it. The
  ticket stays Merging and its MR stays open, unpolled, forever — and
  `retry-auto-resolve` cannot help, because there is no Watchdog left to
  re-arm. `restart-watchdog` starts a replacement on the same MR from the
  ticket's row, replaying the lane (auto-merge, review-gate) the original ran
  on, without a full re-dispatch through the review gate. It refuses when a Watchdog is
  already running: two on one MR would race the merge and double-dispatch fix
  passes. `restart_watchdog` (underscored) is accepted as an alias.

  `rerun-ci` is the operator's CI-retry verb, and it exists because the forge's
  own affordance is a trap. "Re-run failed jobs" — the button a human reaches
  for first — REUSES every job in the run that already succeeded. When the
  failing check tests an artifact an earlier job in that run produced (a
  per-branch review app, a built image), re-running only the failed job
  re-tests the identical stale artifact and fails identically, every time. So
  this verb makes the granularity explicit:

      --mode auto         (default) escalate past failed_jobs automatically
                          whenever completed upstream jobs would be reused, or
                          the run is already on attempt 2+
      --mode failed_jobs  re-run only the failed jobs (reuses upstream output)
      --mode all_jobs     re-run the whole run, REBUILDING upstream jobs
      --mode workflow     fresh workflow_dispatch; the only mode that can
                          carry --input k=v pairs (e.g. force_deploy=true).
                          Pairing --input with --mode failed_jobs/all_jobs is
                          an error, not a silent drop.

  `mark-ci-external` is where an "infrastructure is broken repo-wide, this is
  not my diff" verdict goes. It reclassifies a `:ci_failed` park as
  `:ci_failed_external` and carries the note into the coordinator escalation,
  so the page reads as broken CI rather than as broken code. The note is
  mandatory: an unevidenced "it's not me" is not something an operator can act
  on.
