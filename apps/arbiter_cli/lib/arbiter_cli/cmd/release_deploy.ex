  @moduledoc """
  `arb server deploy [--version vX.Y.Z] [--timeout SECONDS] [--json] [--force]`
  — deploy the Arbiter server from a **GitHub Release** (the OTP release tarball
  published by `.github/workflows/release.yml`), rather than a `git pull` + Mix
  rebuild of a working checkout.

  `arb server deploy --local <tarball|dir>` deploys a **locally built**
  release instead — the tarball or unpacked `_build/prod/rel/arbiter`
  directory produced by `scripts/build-local-release.sh` from a fast-forwarded
  `main`. It shares every step below (unpack, atomic swap, restart,
  health-check, auto-rollback, prune) with the GitHub flow; the only
  difference is where the release tree comes from, and that a local build has
  no published tag or checksum to verify against, so it is assigned a
  synthetic `local-<timestamp>` tag and skips the post-swap version-string
  comparison (which only makes sense against a version GitHub told us to
  expect). `--force`, `--timeout`, `--json`, and
  `--allow-cross-migration-rollback` all work the same with `--local`;
  `--version` is a GitHub-flow-only option and is ignored when `--local` is
  given.

  This is the production deploy path: the box that runs Arbiter no longer needs
  a source checkout or a Mix/Elixir toolchain — only the prebuilt, self-contained
  OTP release. The legacy `git pull` deploy remains available behind
  `arb server deploy --git-pull` until the cutover is complete (see
  `ArbiterCli.Cmd.Update`).

  ## What it does

    1. **Resolve the target release.** Query the GitHub Releases API for
       `latest` (or the tag named by `--version`). The `owner/repo` comes from
       `ARB_RELEASE_REPO`; a `GITHUB_TOKEN`, if set, authenticates the request
       (required for private repos, and lifts the anonymous rate limit).
    2. **Download the asset + checksum.** Fetch `arbiter-<tag>-linux.tar.gz`
       and its `arbiter-<tag>-linux.tar.gz.sha256` sidecar.
    3. **Verify sha256.** Recompute the tarball's SHA-256 and compare it to the
       published checksum. A mismatch aborts before anything touches disk state.
    4. **Unpack** to `<data-home>/releases/<tag>/` (the OTP release tree, so
       `<data-home>/releases/<tag>/bin/arbiter` is the runnable binary).
    5. **Atomically swap** the `<data-home>/current` symlink to the new release
       (symlink-then-rename, so readers never observe a missing/partial link).
    6. **Restart + health-check.** Bounce the service (via systemd when the
       `arbiter.service` user unit is present) and poll `arb doctor` until
       green. Migrations run *here*, inside the new release's own boot — see
       "Migration ordering" below.
    7. **Auto-rollback on failure.** If the stack does not come back green
       within the timeout, re-point `current` at the prior release and restart,
       leaving the server on the last-known-good version. The command then exits
       non-zero so the operator knows the new version was rejected. **Unless
       this deploy crossed a migration** — see "Cross-migration rollback".
       **Unless the server was already down before this deploy began** — see
       "Cold deploy" below.
    8. **Prune.** Retain the current release plus the 3 most-recent prior
       releases under `<data-home>/releases/`; delete anything older.

  ## Cold deploy (bd-5zvux5)

  Step 7's auto-rollback assumes there was a healthy server to protect. Two
  cases break that assumption: a first-ever deploy to a fresh host (no
  `current` yet — the runbook's bootstrap step), and a planned-downtime
  deploy like moving the SQLite database into place, which requires the
  server *stopped* while the file is copied (SQLite allows exactly one
  writer). In both, the pre-flight doctor snapshot (step 1 of "What it does")
  finds the stack down before this command has touched anything.

  This is detected automatically — no flag needed — from the same
  `Doctor.reachable?()` sample `Restart.perform/2` takes right before it
  stops/starts anything. When that sample is false, a subsequent green-wait
  timeout skips auto-rollback entirely: there is nothing healthy to roll back
  to, so `current` stays on the new release (already unpacked, swapped, and
  started) and the command reports that release's own doctor result as the
  outcome, not "the stack is down" framed as this deploy's fault. When the
  sample is true — the ordinary case — auto-rollback behaves exactly as
  before.

  ## Migration ordering (bd-bksulf)

  This command does **not** run migrations. It used to `eval
  Arbiter.Release.migrate` out of the freshly-unpacked release between steps 4
  and 5 — which put a second SQLite *writer* on the database while the old
  server was still serving from it. SQLite allows exactly one writer, and the
  coordinator's own guidance (#754) is that a separate migrate must never run
  against a live server.

  Migration is instead the new release's own boot step:
  `Arbiter.Boot.Migrator` is a synchronous child that migrates to head before
  `ArbiterWeb.Endpoint` binds its port, and it is gated on
  `Arbiter.SingleInstance.primary?/0` so only one node ever migrates. So the
  real ordering is **stop old → (new boots) migrate → serve**, with exactly one
  writer at every instant, and it is the same path dev mode, `arb start`,
  `arb restart` and `arb update` already take. The `Arbiter.Release.migrate`
  eval remains available for an operator who wants to migrate by hand with the
  service stopped.

  ## Cross-migration rollback (bd-bksulf)

  Rolling `current` back to the prior release after the new one has already
  migrated the database puts old code on a schema it has never seen. Before
  swapping, the deploy therefore compares the migrations packaged into the new
  release tree against those in the release it would roll back to
  (`ReleaseFiles.crossed_migrations/2` — a pure filesystem comparison, no DB
  connection). If the new release adds any:

    * the deploy **refuses** to auto-roll back on a health-check failure,
      leaves `current` on the new release, names the crossed migrations, and
      exits non-zero; and
    * `--allow-cross-migration-rollback` overrides that, rolling back anyway
      with a loud warning that the prior release is now on a newer schema.

  A deploy that adds no migrations keeps the automatic rollback exactly as it
  was.

  ## Layout

  All deploy state lives under a data home (default `~/.arbiter`, override with
  `ARB_DATA_HOME`):

      <data-home>/
        current -> releases/v0.1.0      # atomically-swapped symlink
        releases/
          v0.1.0/bin/arbiter
          v0.0.2/bin/arbiter
          …

  The systemd unit is expected to exec `<data-home>/current/bin/arbiter start`,
  so swapping the symlink + restarting is all that's needed to change versions.

  ## Configuration

    * `ARB_RELEASE_REPO` — `owner/repo` to pull releases from (required).
    * `GITHUB_TOKEN` — optional; authenticates the Releases API request.
    * `ARB_DATA_HOME` — deploy root (default `~/.arbiter`).
    * `ARB_GITHUB_API` — Releases API base (default `https://api.github.com`).

  ## Exit codes

    * `0` — the target release was deployed and the stack is green (or it was
      already the current release).
    * `1` — a precondition failed (missing config, API/download error, checksum
      mismatch, unpack failure) **or** the new release failed its health check
      and was rolled back (or had its rollback refused because the deploy
      crossed a migration).

  What an automatic rollback would do, decided before the symlink swap:

    * `:prior_target` — the release dir to fall back to, or `nil` when there is
      none (a failed first-ever deploy).
    * `:crossed` — migrations the new release ships that `prior_target` does
      not, i.e. the ones a rollback would strand. Always `[]` when
      `prior_target` is `nil`.
    * `:detected` — we actually found migrations packaged in the new release
      tree. An arbiter release always ships some (72 and counting), so an empty
      set means the detection globs no longer match the release layout, not
      that the deploy is migration-free. `crossed: []` is only trustworthy when
      this is true.
