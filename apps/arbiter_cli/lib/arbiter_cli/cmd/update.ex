defmodule ArbiterCli.Cmd.Update do
  @moduledoc """
  `arb update` wears two hats, chosen by whether you name an issue.

  ## Deploy mode — `arb update [--timeout SECONDS] [--json]`

  With **no issue id**, `arb update` deploys freshly-merged work: it
  `git pull --ff-only`s the integration branch (`main`) in the Arbiter
  checkout, then runs an explicit deploy sequence: migrations → CLI escript
  rebuild (if changed) → Phoenix restart. One verb for the contributor +
  coordinator to ship merged work.

  Steps:

    1. **Locate the checkout** — the Arbiter project root (same resolution as
       `arb start`/`arb restart`: `ARB_HOME`, the escript's umbrella, or a
       walk up for `compose.yml`).
    2. **Refuse to clobber work.** Abort if the working tree is dirty, or if
       `HEAD` isn't on the integration branch — deploying is a fast-forward of
       `main`, never a merge or a branch switch under a running server.
    3. **`git pull --ff-only`.** A non-fast-forward (diverged history) makes
       git itself abort; we surface its message rather than force anything.
    4. **Report the short log** of the commits that arrived
       (`git log --oneline old..new`). If nothing arrived, say "already up to
       date" and exit — there's no new code to load.
    5. **Apply database migrations — never against a live server.** SQLite has a
       single writer, so a standalone `mix arbiter.migrate` run while the old
       server is still serving contends with it and fails with `queue_timeout`
       (bd-bksulf). When the server is reachable we skip the standalone step
       entirely: the restart in step 7 boots `Boot.Migrator`, which applies
       pending migrations synchronously before the endpoint opens, so the
       ordering is always stop -> migrate -> serve. Only when the server is
       already down (nothing holding the writer) do we run `mix arbiter.migrate`
       here and report how many migrations it applied.
    6. **Rebuild and install the CLI escript** if `apps/arbiter_cli` changed
       in the pulled commits. Detects changes via `git diff --name-only`, builds
       via `mix escript.build`, and installs to `~/.local/bin/arb`, making it
       executable. Skips rebuild if the CLI didn't change.
    7. **Restart Phoenix** via `ArbiterCli.Cmd.Restart.perform/2` to load the
       freshly-pulled code. Also re-runs the boot reconciler.

  ## Issue-edit mode — `arb update <id> [field flags]`

  With an **issue id**, `arb update` patches that issue's fields:

      arb update <id> [--priority N] [--append-notes text]
                      [--description d] [--acceptance a]
                      [--qa-notes text] [--deployment-notes text]
                      [--pr-body text] [--repo owner/name]

  `--assignee` is deprecated (bd-1ozks5): Arbiter is a local single-user app
  and no longer tracks an assignee locally, so the flag is accepted and
  ignored with a stderr warning rather than rejected outright — for one
  release, so an existing script that still passes it doesn't break.

  There is no `--status`: a ticket's lifecycle `state` only moves through its
  transitions (`arb ticket promote` / `demote` / `close` / `reopen`), so the
  flag is refused with that pointer rather than silently dropped.

  `--acceptance` sets the acceptance criteria field, which guides the worker
  in implementing and testing the change.

  `--qa-notes` / `--deployment-notes` set the gated completion-notes fields
  a worker produces for tracker-backed work (QA Testing Notes / Deployment
  Notes on the Jira ticket). They overwrite the field (unlike `--append-notes`).

  `--repo` assigns the task to a repo (a configured `repo_paths` key). Every
  dispatch of the task then binds that repo, so a multi-repo workspace no longer
  needs `repo` passed per dispatch. An explicit `arb dispatch <id> <repo>` still
  overrides it for that one run.

  `--pr-body` sets the worker-authored PR/MR description the MergeQueue opens
  the task's single canonical PR with (Summary / Test plan / References). It
  overwrites the field.

  `--verify-after-deploy` / `--no-verify-after-deploy` (bd-9so315) flags the
  task as one whose only execution context is the long-lived server. When set,
  merging the task's PR moves it to `verifying` instead of closing
  it, and the coordinator restarts and observes the new path before recording
  the result with `arb ticket verify`.

  `--require-provider <p>` / `--exclude-provider <p>` (bd-13pqcp) constrain where
  the ticket's implementer may run — only those providers, or anything but those
  (repeatable, comma lists; `claude`, `gemini`, `codex`, `agy` = `gemini`) — and
  `--clear-provider-constraint` drops it. A ticket carries one of the two. Every
  dispatch path honours it (Autopilot, routing, failover, resume, fix and
  conflict passes); with no allowed provider free the ticket is held, never run
  on an excluded one. The reviewer is not constrained. Coordinator/operator only.

  `--resume-review` clears a ReviewPatrol engagement's per-engagement circuit
  breaker (bd-1atwts), letting the engagement post again after a coordinator
  has adjudicated a review loop. It calls the typed
  `POST /api/issues/:id/resume_review` operation (P-14) — `PATCH /api/issues`
  no longer accepts raw `circuit_breaker_*` writes. It's a resume-only switch:
  it never sets the flag, only clears it. Given alongside field flags, the
  fields are patched first, then the breaker is resumed.

  `--append-notes` appends the given string to the existing `notes` field
  (separated by two newlines). This requires fetching the issue first so we
  don't lose existing notes.

  ## Why one verb

  The two modes never collide: editing an issue *requires* an id, so any
  invocation with a positional argument is an edit, and a bare `arb update`
  (which previously just errored "requires a ticket id") becomes the deploy.

  ## Exit codes

    * `0` — issue patched, or deploy succeeded (or was already up to date).
    * `1` — a bad invocation, an API error, a dirty/diverged checkout, or
      Phoenix not coming back green after the restart.
