  `arb doctor` — health checks.

  Currently runs:

    1. Can we reach `GET /api/workspaces`? (Phoenix reachable)
    2. Does at least one workspace exist? (DB reachable + reasonable state)
    3. Can we resolve the configured workspace? (ARB_WORKSPACE, else the
       workspace named "default", else the sole workspace if there's only one)
    4. Do any repos resolve? (zero repos means nothing can be dispatched)
    5. Do the CLI and server report the same version?
    6. Are database migrations up to date?
    7. Is the server bound to a loopback address? (the dashboard has no login)
       And does `/api` refuse a caller with no bearer token? (`[fail]` and
       exit 1 when an anonymous write or cross-workspace read is served)
    8. Is Erlang distribution loopback-only, with an owner-only cookie?
       (epmd + the release node's listener; `[fail]` and exit 1 otherwise)
    9. Is it safe to restart? (the scheduler drain state — `[fail]` while a
       paused scheduler is still draining; informational, never fatal)

   10. Nodes (RW7): is `nodes.public_url` reachable (an anonymous `GET
       /nodes/ping`) and a private endpoint, is each enrolled node online,
       current and within its cap, is the local worker cap above 0, and do the
       caps fit `conductor.max_concurrent`? (`[fail]` but never fatal)

  Exit code 0 on all green, 1 on any failure.

  True when every readiness-blocking health check passes. `fatal` alone can't
  gate this: it also drives `arb doctor`'s exit code, and some checks (like
  workspace resolution) are operator-actionable failures worth a non-zero
  exit without saying anything about whether the deployed server is healthy.
  `blocks_readiness` is the narrower signal `arb server deploy`'s
  auto-rollback wait actually needs.
