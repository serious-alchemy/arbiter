  `arb server <verb>` — manage the Arbiter server stack (SQLite + Phoenix).

      arb server deploy   [--version vX.Y.Z] [--timeout SECONDS] [--json] [--force]

                          [--no-self-update]
                          deploy from a GitHub Release: download + verify
                          arbiter-<v>-linux.tar.gz → atomically swap the
                          current symlink → restart → health-check, with
                          auto-rollback on failure.
                          Migrations are NOT run by the deploy: the new
                          release applies them on its own boot via
                          Boot.Migrator, after the old server is stopped, so
                          there is never a second SQLite writer.
                          A deploy that adds migrations the prior release
                          lacks therefore refuses to auto-roll back (old code
                          on a new schema); pass
                          --allow-cross-migration-rollback to override.
                          The release repo comes from `ARB_RELEASE_REPO`,
                          else the running server's own release metadata,
                          else the repo this arb was built from; the output
                          names which. Before the swap the database gets an
                          integrity-checked online backup
                          (<data-home>/snapshots/), which a failed deploy of
                          a release with migrations restores. After a green
                          deploy the arb escript is updated to the same tag.
                          This never falls back to git-pull: a source
                          checkout is deployed only with --git-pull.
      arb server deploy --git-pull [--timeout SECONDS] [--json] [--force]
                          dev-runtime path: git pull --ff-only main → rebuild
                          CLI if changed → restart Phoenix.
                          Use this after a `git pull` that brought in new
                          migrations; it applies them and reloads the server in
                          one step. Like the release path, it never migrates
                          against the live server: when the server is up the
                          restart's Boot.Migrator applies pending migrations on
                          boot, before the endpoint opens. Only a server that is
                          already down gets a standalone `mix arbiter.migrate`.
                          Only runs when asked for: a bare `arb server deploy`
                          is always the release path.
      arb server migrate  [--timeout SECONDS] [--json] [--force]
                          apply pending database migrations.
                          When the server is running: restarts it so
                          Boot.Migrator can apply migrations as a synchronous
                          boot step — running `mix arbiter.migrate` standalone
                          races the live SQLite writer and fails with
                          queue_timeout. Pass --force to bypass the active-
                          worker guard.
                          When the server is down: runs migrations standalone
                          (safe — no competing connection).
      arb server doctor   [--all|-v] [--json]
                          health checks: ok / warn / fail (exit 1 only on
                          fail). Default output is the failing and warning
                          checks only; --all lists every check, grouped.
      arb server version  [--json]

  ## Dev-runtime deploy runbook

  After a `git pull` that includes new migrations, the dev Phoenix server
  hot-reloads the new code but NOT the schema. The next request hits
  `Phoenix.Ecto.CheckRepoStatus`, which raises `PendingMigrationError` and
  500s every request until the migration is applied.

  **Correct fix:**

      arb server deploy --git-pull   # pull → restart (migrates on boot)

  or, if you already pulled manually:

      arb server migrate             # restart (applies migrations via Boot.Migrator)
      # — or —
      arb restart                    # same effect; Boot.Migrator runs on every boot

  **Never run a standalone `mix arbiter.migrate` against a live server** —
  it competes for the single SQLite writer connection and fails with
  `queue_timeout`. Every deploy verb here enforces that: `arb server migrate`
  detects a running server and redirects to restart, and both deploy paths
  (release and `--git-pull`) leave pending migrations to `Boot.Migrator` on the
  next boot, after the old server is stopped.
