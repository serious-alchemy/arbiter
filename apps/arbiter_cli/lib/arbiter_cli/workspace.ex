defmodule ArbiterCli.Workspace do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves the active workspace.

  Lookup order when `ARB_WORKSPACE` is unset:
    1. Workspace literally named `"default"`
    2. The sole workspace, if exactly one exists (an install that never had —
       or has since deleted — a workspace named `"default"` should still just
       work when there's no ambiguity about which workspace is "active")

  When `ARB_WORKSPACE` (or `--workspace`) is set, it is matched exactly by
  name or id and no fallback applies — an explicit selector that doesn't
  match is always an error.

  Returns `{:ok, workspace_map}` or `{:error, reason_string}`.

  alias ArbiterCli.Client

  @doc """
  Pull a `--workspace <name>` / `--workspace=<name>` (or `-w`) flag out of an
  arg list, returning `{name_or_nil, remaining_argv}`.

  Workspace selection is a cross-cutting concern resolved centrally via
  `ARB_WORKSPACE` (see `resolve/0`), but the individual `arb ticket *`
  subcommands each parse their own switches and would otherwise swallow a
  `--workspace` flag as an unknown boolean. Extracting it here — before the
  subcommand's own `OptionParser` runs — lets the flag override the active
  workspace exactly as the env var does, for every subcommand uniformly.

  The last occurrence wins. The returned name is applied by the caller via
  `System.put_env("ARB_WORKSPACE", name)`.
