defmodule Arbiter.Worker.ReleaseEnv do
  @moduledoc """
  Strips OTP-release environment variables from worker subshell environments.

  When arbiter runs as a systemd OTP release (bd-aj6fv5), the service unit
  exports ROOTDIR, BINDIR, and RELEASE_* into the process environment. These
  variables are inherited by every `Port.open` child, including the Claude
  workers spawned in worktrees. If a worker shell runs `mix test` (or `elixir`
  / `erl` / `arb`), the Erlang runtime reads ROOTDIR and BINDIR to find its OTP
  libs and boot scripts — and finds the release's ERTS instead of the
  worktree's mise-pinned toolchain. The resulting crash:

      Runtime terminating during boot ({'cannot get bootfile',
        '/opt/arbiter/releases/v0.1.5/bin/no_dot_erlang.boot'})

  is the exact failure bd-4hkzn3 investigates. The ReviewGate degrades to
  static-analysis-only because `mix test` cannot boot.

  ## Fix

  `clean_pairs/0` returns `{name, false}` pairs for each release var currently
  set in the VM process environment. Erlang's `Port.open` interprets `false` as
  "unset this var in the child's environment" — so passing these pairs into the
  `{:env, pairs}` Port option removes them from the child without touching any
  other inherited var.

  It also returns a PATH override that strips the release's ERTS and bin dirs
  so `erl`, `erlc`, and `mix` (found via mise shims) resolve to the
  per-worktree toolchain rather than the release's bundled ERTS.

  ## The shared helper (bd-2oelme)

  `clean_pairs/0` is the raw material; callers must not splice it in by hand.
  Every spawn that can start a BEAM (`mix`, `elixir`, `erl`, `iex`) or an agent
  CLI (`claude`, `agy`, `codex`) — or a `sh -c` that may run one — goes through
  exactly one of:

    * `cmd/3` — a `System.cmd/3` drop-in that merges the cleanup pairs into
      the `:env` option (using `nil` to unset, which is what `System.cmd/3`
      understands).
    * `port_env/1` — returns `[{name, value | false}]` for `Port.open`'s
      `{:env, …}` option (`false` unsets, which is what Erlang's port driver
      understands), with caller pairs appended so they can still override.

  `Arbiter.Worker.ClaudeSession.env_pairs/3` (all worker Port.opens),
  `Arbiter.Agents.Preflight` (the auth probe), `Arbiter.Worker.Worktree`
  (`mix deps.get` worktree seeding), `Arbiter.Workflows.CodeReview.Checks`
  (the ReviewGate reviewer), `Arbiter.Workflows.ReviewReply` (the reply
  composer), `Arbiter.Quota.CloudCode` (the `agy` usage probe) and
  `ArbiterCli.Cmd.Start.run_cmd/3` (the `arb` escript's single spawn point,
  which runs `mix compile` / `mix arbiter.migrate` / `mix escript.build` /
  `sh -c "nohup mix phx.server …"`) are the call sites.
  `release_env_guard_test.exs` holds the full inventory and fails if a new
  spawn site appears without being classified.

  ## Why this is its own umbrella app

  `:arbiter_cli` builds the `arb` escript and cannot depend on `:arbiter` at
  runtime (it pulls it in `only: :test`; see apps/arbiter_cli/mix.exs), but it
  spawns `mix` too. Living in `:arbiter_release_env` — a dependency-free app
  both `:arbiter` and `:arbiter_cli` depend on — is what lets criterion 2 of
  bd-2oelme ("one shared helper, no per-site copies") hold across both.

  Pure-tool spawns (`git`, `gh`, `glab`, `cp`, `kill`, `pgrep`, `diff`) are
  deliberately left alone: they never read ROOTDIR/BINDIR, and stripping vars
  from them would only add noise.
