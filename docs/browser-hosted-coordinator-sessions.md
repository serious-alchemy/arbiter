# Browser-hosted coordinator sessions — design spec

**Status:** design proposal (deliverable for #1581; not yet approved)
**Date:** 2026-09-13
**Task:** bd-cyxzvq · **Tracker:** github:1581
**Author:** worker
**Builds on:** the usage ledger's session attribution (`apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/usage/event.ex`,
bd-adyhvn / #1596), the session-JSONL archive (`docs/session-archive.md`, bd-db0p38),
per-agent config isolation (`Arbiter.Agents.Claude.ConfigDir`, bd-bw3466) and the
MCP scope tiers (`docs/mcp-server-design.md`, bd-b2eqn5).

> **Amendments folded in.** This spec is written against the four amendments on
> bd-cyxzvq, not the original ticket text. In particular the metering proxy the
> ticket was built on **no longer exists** (removed in #1605) — §2 and §7 replace
> it — and the memory/continuity question the ticket left open has since been
> **decided** by the operator; §9.4 designs to that decision rather than
> re-opening it.

## TL;DR

Run each coordinator session as **`tmux` inside its own transient systemd user
unit**, spawned by Arbiter via `systemd-run --user --scope`, and attach the
browser to it through a Phoenix Channel carrying raw ANSI. Meter it by
**ingesting the session's own Claude Code JSONL** — no proxy — into the existing
`Usage.Event` ledger under `source: :coordinator_session`.

Three empirical results drive the design (§4.2, §8.2, §7.2 for full commands and
observations):

1. **Restart survival is a cgroup problem, not a process-parentage problem.**
   `arbiter.service` sets no `KillMode`, so systemd's default `control-group`
   applies and kills *everything in the unit's cgroup* on restart — double-forking
   does not escape it. Measured: a tmux server spawned as a plain child of a
   stand-in service **died** on `systemctl --user restart`; an identical one
   placed in its own transient scope **survived**, and replayed **ticks 1..58
   with zero gaps** across the restart instant with no client ever attached.

2. **Proxy-free metering works in mode B with Remote Control active** — the
   blocking critical-path question from Amendment 2/4, and the answer is
   **positive**. In the operator's own bridged session, `totalCostUSD` climbed
   **$9.78 → $325.78 entirely inside the bridged window**, alongside 4,216
   `usage`-bearing records. Turns driven from claude.ai still land their tokens
   and dollars in the local JSONL. **No blocking finding to report.**

3. **`--remote-control` under an OAuth token fails *silently*, which is worse
   than the reported refusal.** It does not error. It starts a completely normal
   interactive session, runs turns fine, and just never establishes the bridge —
   zero `bridge-session` records, no `bridge*` keys, no `oauthAccount`. An
   operator would believe they had an AFK-reachable session and would not. Arbiter
   must **verify the bridge**, not trust the flag (§8.3).

The headline number for §1: that single measured session cost **$325.78** and
appears in `arb usage` as **$0.00**.

## 1. Motivation — the coordinator is the largest unmetered line item

`arb usage` reports dispatched workers. The coordinator session that *dispatches*
them is invisible. Every quota figure the operator produced on 2026-09-11/12 had
to carry the caveat "worker ledger only — the coordinator session and interactive
use also consume quota but are not in the ledger".

That gap is now quantified rather than asserted. Reading the operator's own
session JSONL (§7.2):

| | |
|---|---|
| one interactive coordinator session | **$325.78** |
| its `usage`-bearing assistant records | 4,216 |
| its size on disk | 25 MB / 14,550 lines |
| what `arb usage` shows for it | **$0.00** |

The operator's 2026-09-12 analysis put coordinator/interactive use at roughly **a
quarter of total consumption**. A cost report that omits a quarter of spend is not
a rounding error; it is the wrong answer, and it is wrong in the direction that
makes the fleet look cheaper than it is.

Two further motivations, both from the ticket: hosting the session lets Arbiter
**inject the context a coordinator needs** (workspace state, task queues, memory
layers) instead of relying on the operator to paste it, and it makes the session a
**first-class object** — startable, nameable, reattachable, auditable — rather
than a terminal window that exists only as long as a laptop stays awake.

### 1.1 Why the ledger is already half-built

This is the part the original ticket could not know. #1596 landed the attribution
schema **before** this RFC was written:

- `Usage.Event.task_id` is nullable.
- `@sources` already contains `:coordinator_session` and `:terminal_session`
  (`apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/usage/event.ex:66`).
- `session_id` already exists as an attribute (`:210`).
- `arb usage` already accepts `--by source` and `--source coordinator_session`.

So the ledger is waiting for rows that nothing currently writes. The metering work
in §7 is **a producer**, not a schema redesign. `event.ex:45` even names this
ticket as the intended writer.

## 2. What changed under this RFC while it was queued

The ticket was filed 2026-09-12 05:21Z against an architecture that has since been
dismantled. Recording this explicitly because the original research tasks point at
modules that are gone:

| Change | Effect on this design |
|---|---|
| **#1605** deleted the Anthropic pass-through proxy — controller, route, `worker_base_url/1`, and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` from the spawn env | The ticket's "point `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at the proxy" path **does not exist**. §7 is proxy-free. |
| **#1602** deleted `RefreshProbe`; quota is now polled from `/api/oauth/usage` by `CloudProbe` | Gives account-level utilisation **percentages**, not per-request tokens. Cannot meter a session. |
| **#1596** made `task_id` nullable and added `source` + `session_id` | The attribution half is **done**. Extend it (§7.4). |
| **bd-db0p38** archives session JSONLs before Claude Code prunes them at ~21 days | The metering *and* transcript substrate already exists (§11). |

Reintroducing a proxy purely for sessions would re-add a component that was
deliberately removed, to obtain data that is already on disk. §7.3 evaluates it
anyway and rejects it on those grounds.

## 3. Architecture

```

The browser-side box was `SessionLive` (`/sessions/:id`) through phase 2. Phase 3
(bd-a292yj) deleted that page and moved the terminal, its controls and the cost
HUD into the dock, which is the sticky `SessionDockLive` present on every page —
see §6.5. The channel below it is unchanged.

The load-bearing property is the **restart boundary**: everything below it lives
in a cgroup that is a *sibling* of `arbiter.service`, so `systemctl --user restart
arbiter` cannot reach it. Arbiter holds no handle to the PTY that matters — on
reboot it re-discovers sessions by listing scope units and tmux sockets.

## 4. The PTY harness (research task 1)

### 4.1 The real constraint

The instinct is "a PTY owned by the supervision tree dies with the BEAM, so
double-fork it away". That instinct is **wrong on this host**, and the spike was
worth running precisely because it disproves the obvious answer.

`arbiter.service` is `Type=exec` and sets **no `KillMode`**, so the systemd default
`KillMode=control-group` applies. On restart systemd signals *every process in the
unit's cgroup*. Reparenting to PID 1 does not move a process out of a cgroup —
cgroup membership is inherited across `fork()` and preserved across `setsid()`.
So `setsid`, daemonising, and "tmux double-forks anyway" **all still die**.

Survival requires the PTY to be in a **different cgroup**, which on a systemd user
session means: in its own unit.

### 4.2 Spike — commands run and what was observed

Run 2026-09-13 against a throwaway transient unit standing in for
`arbiter.service` (same user manager, same default `KillMode`, no blast radius on
the live coordinator). Predictions were recorded before running.

**Setup** — one stand-in service spawning two PTYs, one each way:

```sh
# inside the stand-in service's ExecStart:
tmux -S $SOCK_A new-session -d -s coord "$WORKLOAD"                 # plain child
systemd-run --user --scope --quiet --unit=$TAG-ptyB \
  tmux -S $SOCK_B new-session -d -s coord "$WORKLOAD"               # escaped
```

The workload prints a numbered tick every 0.5 s, so output can be checked for gaps.

**Observed — cgroup placement (the mechanism):**

```
tmux[A] pid=1670957 cgroup=…/app.slice/arbspike1581-host.service
tmux[B] pid=1670971 cgroup=…/app.slice/arbspike1581-ptyB.scope
```

**Observed — a real restart cycle:**

```
$ systemctl --user restart arbspike1581-host.service     # rc=0, returned in 23ms
host MainPID before=1670952 after=1671655                # service genuinely restarted
tmux[A] pid=1670957  DEAD
tmux[B] pid=1670971  ALIVE  (cmd: /usr/bin/tmux -S …/tmuxB.sock new-se…)
scope state: active
```

**Observed — detached output replay.** No client was ever attached
(`attached_clients=0`). After the restart:

```
$ tmux -S $SOCK_B capture-pane -p -S - -t coord
tick 1 04:37:06.541 … tick 58 04:37:35.189
range 1..58, count 58        # gap check: no missing tick numbers
```

Tick 26 landed at 04:37:19.105 — **7 ms after `systemctl restart` returned**. The
program neither blocked nor lost output while unattended; tmux buffered it into
pane history. Default `history-limit` is **30000 lines**.

**Observed — the mechanisms the transport needs:**

```
$ tmux -S $SOCK_B resize-window -t coord -x 120 -y 40
after resize: 120x40                       # resize reaches a detached session
$ tmux -S $SOCK_B capture-pane -p -e -S -3 -t coord
                                           # -e preserves ANSI for replay into xterm.js
$ tmux -S $SOCK_B pipe-pane -t coord -O "cat >> transcript.raw"
bytes captured in 2s: 88                   # live raw byte stream, transcript + tail
```

**Observed — a literal attach / detach / restart / reattach cycle.** The capture
above proves survival; this proves the session is still a usable terminal
afterwards, with a real tmux client attaching (run from an outer tmux pane, so
the client has a genuine TTY):

```sh
tmux -S $SOCK attach -t coord      # attached_clients: 0 -> 1, client renders live ticks
tmux -S $SOCK detach-client -s coord                      # 1 -> 0
systemctl --user restart <stand-in-arbiter>               # PTY pid SURVIVED
tmux -S $SOCK attach -t coord      # 0 -> 1, client renders live ticks 32,33,34
```

Continuity across the whole cycle: `ticks 1..34, count 34` — no gaps introduced by
attaching, detaching, restarting, or reattaching.

**Observed — arbiter never returning:**

```
$ systemctl --user stop arbspike1581-host.service
host: inactive   scope: active
tmux still serving: coord: 1 windows
```

The session outlives arbiter indefinitely. See §4.6.

Teardown was by exact unit and socket name (`systemctl --user stop <unit>`,
`tmux -S <sock> kill-server`); `systemctl --user is-active arbiter.service`
confirmed `active` afterwards.

**This whole section is now an automated test.** Phase 2 (bd-b95w36) turned
these observations into
`apps/arbiter/test/integration/session_restart_survival_test.exs`, negative
control included — see §4.9.

### 4.3 Recommendation — transient systemd user unit, tmux inside it

```sh
systemd-run --user --scope --unit=arb-session-<id> --collect \
  tmux -S $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/arbiter/session-<id>.sock \
       new-session -d -s coord -x 200 -y 50 \
       -e CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=… -e ARB_SESSION_ID=… \
       "claude <launch-flags>"
```

Why this pair, rather than either alone:

- **systemd gives the lifetime.** The scope is a sibling cgroup, which is the only
  thing that actually survives a restart (§4.1). It also gives us naming
  (`arb-session-<id>`), enumeration (`systemctl --user list-units 'arb-session-*'`)
  and resource limits for free.
- **tmux gives the PTY, the scrollback and the second door.** It is a real PTY
  master with SIGWINCH handling, 30k lines of replay buffer, `pipe-pane` for a
  live byte stream, and — decisively for AC 6 — a **CLI attach path that does not
  involve Arbiter at all** (§4.7).

tmux 3.7c is already installed on this host; `dtach`, `abduco` and `screen` are
not, and `script` is not either. Adding a dependency that is already present beats
adding one that is not.

Arbiter holds **no** long-lived handle to the PTY. It shells out for control
operations and keeps one reader per attached browser. This is the property that
makes restart survival true by construction rather than by careful coding: there
is no supervision link to sever.

### 4.4 Rejected alternatives

| Alternative | Why it loses |
|---|---|
| **In-BEAM PTY (`:erlexec`, `expty`)** | Fatal on the hard requirement. The PTY master is a BEAM-owned fd; when the BEAM exits the master closes, the slave gets `SIGHUP`, and the session dies. A coordinator that restarts arbiter would kill itself mid-restart — the exact scenario decision 1 forbids, and one that has occurred twice in one day in practice. `:erlexec`'s OS-level middleman does not help: it is spawned by the BEAM, lives in `arbiter.service`'s cgroup, and §4.2 shows that cgroup is cleared on restart. Also: neither is in `mix.lock`, both add a NIF/port-driver dependency, and `expty` would put a C NIF in the path of the operator's primary interface. |
| **Detachable multiplexer that is *not* in its own unit** (`tmux`/`dtach`/`abduco` spawned as a plain child) | This is variant A, and it was **measured dead** (§4.2). It is the intuitive answer and it is wrong. Worth stating loudly because "tmux detaches, so it survives" is exactly the reasoning a reviewer would accept without testing. `dtach`/`abduco` additionally are not installed. |
| **A separate long-lived daemon** (one `arbiter-ptyd` unit hosting all sessions) | Survives restarts, but re-creates every problem tmux already solved — PTY allocation, scrollback ring, resize, multi-client attach, a wire protocol — as new code on the critical path of the operator's primary interface. It also makes the blast radius *worse*: one daemon crash takes down every session, whereas one scope per session is independently faulty. Its only real advantage (a stable supervision point) is obtainable by enumerating scope units. |
| **A per-session `.service` file written to `~/.config/systemd/user/`** | Works, and is close to the recommendation, but persists state on disk that must be garbage-collected, requires `daemon-reload` per session, and survives reboot in a way that resurrects dead sessions. `--scope` is transient: it exists exactly as long as the processes in it. |
| **`setsid` / double-fork reparenting** | **Does not work here.** Reparenting to PID 1 does not change cgroup membership; systemd kills by cgroup. Measured: variant A's tmux server *had* already double-forked (tmux daemonises its server) and died anyway. |

### 4.5 Output produced while detached

Answered empirically in §4.2: tmux writes into the pane's history ring whether or
not a client is attached, and the process never blocks. On reattach:

1. **Replay** — `capture-pane -p -e -S -<N>` returns the last N lines with ANSI
   intact; the channel ships it as one `snapshot` frame that xterm.js writes
   verbatim before live bytes resume.
2. **Live** — `pipe-pane -O` streams raw bytes from that point on.

The seam between the two is the one place ordering can go wrong. Open `pipe-pane`
**first**, then take the snapshot, then drop any streamed bytes that precede the
snapshot's end marker — overlap is cheap to discard, a gap is not recoverable.

Bound: 30,000 lines per pane by default. For a coordinator session that is
generous (it is a scrollback ring, not the transcript — §11 persists the full
byte stream separately), but §12 flags raising it as a tuning question.

### 4.6 Orphan reaping

The spike refined the prediction here in a way that matters. The transient scope
**self-reaps when its payload exits** — no `RemainAfterExit` needed. But when
arbiter was *stopped entirely*, the scope stayed `active` and tmux kept serving
indefinitely. So systemd garbage-collects the *unit*, never the *session*.

The orphan is therefore a live agent process with nobody watching it, which is
also the expensive failure: an idle `claude` costs nothing, but one in a tool loop
bills against quota with no HUD showing it.

Proposed reaping, in order of preference:

1. **Adoption sweep on boot.** Arbiter enumerates `arb-session-*` scopes at
   startup, matches them against its `sessions` table, and re-adopts. Anything
   with no matching row is an orphan from a previous era → kill. This is also how
   reattach works after a restart, so it is not extra machinery.
2. **Idle deadline.** Each session records `last_client_at` and `last_turn_at`.
   A sweep terminates sessions idle beyond a configured TTL (suggest 24 h), with
   the operator able to pin a session as `keep_alive`.
3. **A dead-man's switch inside the scope.** The scope's payload is a wrapper that
   polls for arbiter's liveness and exits after a grace window (suggest 1 h) with
   no arbiter *and* no attached client. This is the only mechanism that works if
   arbiter never comes back at all, which is the case §4.2 measured.

(3) is the honest answer to "what if arbiter never returns" and should not be
skipped just because (1) covers the common case.

### 4.7 Fallback path when the web app is down (AC 6)

Because the browser is intended to **replace** the terminal, the failure mode
"dashboard down, session unreachable" is unacceptable. It is also trivially
avoided by the recommendation, and this is a large part of why tmux wins:

```sh
# list live sessions without Arbiter running at all
systemctl --user list-units 'arb-session-*' --no-legend

# attach directly, full interactivity, no Phoenix in the path
tmux -S $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/arbiter/session-<id>.sock attach -t coord

# read-only look
tmux -S …/session-<id>.sock attach -r -t coord
```

Nothing in this path touches the BEAM, the database, or the network. Ship it as
`arb session attach <id>` (a thin `exec` wrapper) so the operator does not have to
remember socket paths, and **document the raw `tmux -S … attach` form too** —
`arb` is an escript that talks to the Phoenix API, so it may itself be unavailable
in precisely the scenario this path exists for.

Third door, for when the operator is off the LAN entirely: Remote Control (§8).

### 4.8 Status — phase 1 shipped (bd-bpt0ag, #1682)

The session lifecycle core is implemented and the §4.1 mechanism is now
measured from inside `arbiter.service` itself, not just from a stand-in:

```
spawner (BEAM)   …/user@1000.service/app.slice/arbiter.service
tmux (pid …)     …/user@1000.service/app.slice/arb-session-<uuid>.scope
```

A **sibling** under `app.slice`, exactly as §4.1 predicts. That reading is
produced by `apps/arbiter/test/integration/session_scope_test.exs`, which is
tagged `:live_systemd` and excluded from the default suite — run it with
`mix test --include live_systemd`.

What shipped:

  * `sessions` table + `Arbiter.Sessions.Session`, field-for-field with §7.4
    item 4. `usage_events.session_id` joins to `provider_session_id` by string,
    so the rows phase 6's ingest has been writing since bd-be804c attach to a
    session row as soon as one exists.
  * `Arbiter.Sessions.launch/1` running §4.3's command shape verbatim, plus
    `list/0`, `get/1`, `kill/2`. Control operations shell out through
    `Arbiter.Sessions.Runner` (a behaviour, so tests drive a scripted
    `systemctl`/`tmux`) and its one real implementation goes through
    `ReleaseEnv.cmd/3`, so the release-env scrub happens once at the scope
    boundary and is inherited by the tmux server and every pane.
  * `Arbiter.Sessions.Adoption.sweep/1` as a primary-gated boot task — §4.6
    item 1. Phase 1 deliberately stops short of §4.6's "no matching row →
    kill": an unrecognised live scope is reported in `:orphans` and logged,
    never stopped, because the sweep's model of the host is by definition
    already wrong in that case. Reaping stays phase 10.
  * §10.1's self-kill refusal, enforced in `kill/2`, and the restart
    rate-limit decision as a pure predicate (`Arbiter.Sessions.Guards`)
    waiting for whichever phase adds the restart endpoint.
  * `Arbiter.Sessions.Provider` keeps the payload provider-agnostic. Its
    Claude Code adapter launches a **shell** for now: §9.2's three interactive
    gates mean an unprovisioned `claude` would hang forever in a detached
    pane. Phase 3 swaps the payload, nothing else.

Not done here, and not attempted: transport, UI, provisioning, Remote
Control, and the §4.6 idle deadline / dead-man's switch.

### 4.9 Status — phase 2 shipped: §4.2 is a regression test (bd-b95w36)

§4.8 measures the *mechanism* (sibling cgroup). It cannot measure the
*consequence*, because it launches from the ExUnit BEAM's own cgroup and
nothing ever restarts that. Phase 2 closes that gap:
`apps/arbiter/test/integration/session_restart_survival_test.exs` brings up a
throwaway systemd **user service** standing in for `arbiter.service` — same
user manager, same `KillMode` (both set it by omission, so the default
`control-group` applies; the test reads `arbiter.service`'s own value back and
asserts they match), no blast radius on the live coordinator — launches a
session from inside it through the real `Arbiter.Sessions.launch/1`, and
restarts it for real.

The launch gets *inside* the unit through the phase-1 seam: the unit's
`ExecStart` is a small POSIX `sh` agent watching a command spool, and
`Arbiter.Test.StandinUnit` implements `Arbiter.Sessions.Runner` by writing
into that spool. The argv, the env and the ordering are the production code
path; only the process that executes the argv moves into the restartable
cgroup.

Measured on the arbiter host, 2026-09-15:

```
[bd-b95w36] cgroup placement before the restart:
  stand-in unit      arbrs1413-host.service (MainPID 3037301)
  tmux, escaped      pid 3037377  …/app.slice/arb-session-e4139553-….scope
  tmux, plain child  pid 3037307  …/app.slice/arbrs1413-host.service

[bd-b95w36] restart survival, measured:
  arbrs1413-host.service MainPID  3037301 -> 3037476
  arb-session-e4139553-….scope  active
  tmux, escaped      pid 3037377  ALIVE
  tmux, plain child  pid 3037307  DEAD
  pane ticks         range 1..20, count 20 (restart crossed at 10)

[bd-b95w36] host: inactive   scope: active
```

Four assertions, one per §4.2 observation: the scope is still `active`; the
tmux server is the **same pid**, so it survived rather than restarted; the
pane's sequenced output is contiguous `1..N` across the restart instant (the
spike's "range 1..58, count 58"); and — the negative control — a tmux started
as a *plain child* of the same unit is dead, which is what proves the test is
capable of failing. Verified by mutation: rewriting the runner to launch the
session as a plain child fails both tests, at the cgroup assertion and again
at `scope is inactive after restarting`.

**It is opt-in, and its absence is loud.** GitHub Actions runners generally
have no systemd user instance, so the test is tagged `:systemd_user` and
excluded from `mix precommit`. A restart-survival test that quietly does not
run is worse than none, so `test/test_helper.exs` prints a banner naming the
reason on every run that does not include it, and on a host with no user
manager the module tags itself `skip: <reason>` — ExUnit reports *skipped*,
not passed. Run it with:

```sh
scripts/session-restart-survival.sh          # --log FILE to capture output
```

which checks the preconditions, runs the test from `apps/arbiter` (an umbrella
`mix test <path>` at the root is not scoped to one app), and re-checks
`arbiter.service`'s state afterwards.

### 4.10 Status — phase 10 shipped: orphan reaping + CLI fallback (bd-3qkbch)

§4.6's three mechanisms and §4.7's fallback path are all implemented.

1. **Orphan-scope policy — kill after grace, never on first sighting
   (`Arbiter.Sessions.OrphanReaper`).** Phase 1 deliberately stopped at
   *reporting* an orphan (§4.6 item 1's own text, above). The policy decided
   here: a periodic re-sweep of `Adoption.sweep/1` tracks each orphan's
   first-seen time in memory, and only kills one that has persisted across a
   full grace window (default 1h, `config :arbiter, :sessions_orphan_reaper,
   grace_ms: …`) — never the sweep that first notices it, which is what
   protects a session mid-launch (row written, scope not yet confirmed, or
   the reverse) from being destroyed by a sweep that catches it between the
   two. The kill itself reuses `Adoption`'s own discipline: exact unit/socket
   name, never a pattern match. `decide/4` is the whole policy as a pure
   function, asserted directly against fakes with no systemd/tmux in sight.
   The acceptance criterion's "or operator confirmation" clause is the raw
   `systemctl --user stop` / `tmux kill-session` commands `Adoption`'s own
   orphan log line already hands the operator — an immediate, deliberate
   kill that stays outside this policy entirely.

   `Adoption.sweep/1` itself is not read-only — it marks rows `:running` or
   `:ended` — so this periodic sweep is gated on
   `Arbiter.SingleInstance.primary?()` exactly like `Adoption.sweep_on_boot/1`
   is: a secondary instance must never mark the primary's live sessions
   ended on a timer. `Adoption.sweep/1` also takes a `:context` string now
   (`"adoption sweep at boot"` vs `"periodic orphan-reaper sweep"`), so a row
   this sweep ends carries a true `end_reason` rather than the boot-only
   wording it inherited when this was a once-at-boot call. And because the
   sweep is no longer confined to boot, `Adoption` gives a `:starting` row a
   30s launch grace (`Sessions.launch/1` writes the row before it provisions
   and starts the scope) so a sweep landing inside that window cannot end a
   row `start_scope/2` is about to mark `:running`.
2. **Idle deadline (`Arbiter.Sessions.IdleReaper`).** A periodic sweep
   (default 15m) reaps any `:running`, non-`keep_alive` session whose newest
   of `last_client_at` / `last_turn_at` / `started_at` is older than
   `:idle_ttl_ms` (default 24h, §4.6's own suggested figure), via the same
   `Sessions.kill/2` an operator or the dashboard would use. `keep_alive`
   (`Sessions.set_keep_alive/2`) is an unconditional pin — a session so
   marked is never a candidate, however stale its clock reads, and is
   reachable from the operator's UI (the dock window's "Pin keep_alive"
   overflow item, `/sessions/:id`'s button before bd-a292yj deleted that
   page), not just the API. `last_turn_at` is a new column
   alongside the existing `last_client_at`: a turn actually running is
   activity distinct from a client merely being attached, and without it a
   long-running unattended agent turn would look idle to the sweep. Both
   columns are stamped from production paths, not just tests:
   `ArbiterWeb.SessionChannel` calls `Sessions.touch_client/1` on join and
   again every 5 minutes for as long as a client stays attached (so a
   continuously-attached browser tab never goes stale), and
   `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream` calls `Sessions.touch_turn/1` (throttled to once
   a minute) whenever the pane actually produces output, whether or not a
   client is attached to watch it — the signal the unattended-agent case
   needs.
3. **In-scope dead-man's switch (`watchdog.sh`, generated by
   `Arbiter.Sessions.Provisioning`).** The only mechanism that still works if
   arbiter never comes back at all (§4.2's measured case). `launch.sh`
   backgrounds it before `exec`ing the agent — cgroup membership is inherited
   by `fork()` and untouched by the parent shell being replaced, so it
   survives as a sibling of the agent inside the same scope, the same
   property that keeps the tmux server itself alive (§4.1). It polls (default
   60s) two independent liveness signals and only kills the pane (`tmux
   kill-session`) when **both** fail for the grace window (default 1h,
   `config :arbiter, :sessions_deadman`): arbiter's own heartbeat file
   (`Arbiter.Sessions.Heartbeat` touches it periodically; the watchdog reads
   its mtime, so it needs no connection *to* arbiter, only that one existed at
   some point) and `tmux list-clients` reporting zero attached clients. Either
   signal alone being healthy is enough to hold off — a plain `arbiter`
   restart, or a client that briefly detached, must not reap an otherwise-fine
   session. Tested by running the *actual* generated shell script as a real
   `/bin/sh` subprocess against a fake `tmux` on `PATH` and a heartbeat file
   whose mtime the test sets directly ("injectable liveness") — not a model
   of the script, because the script's whole point is to keep working with
   the BEAM gone entirely.
4. **CLI fallback (`arb session list` / `arb session attach [--read-only]`,
   `apps/arbiter_cli/lib/arbiter_cli/cmd/session.ex`).** Reads `systemctl
   --user list-units 'arb-session-*'` and derives the tmux socket path
   directly — no HTTP, no dependency on the `:arbiter` app, matching the
   RFC's own observation that `arb` itself may be unavailable in exactly the
   scenario this path exists for. `attach` hands the real terminal to `tmux`
   through a `Port.open(..., [:nouse_stdio, ...])` — the child inherits this
   process's actual stdin/stdout/stderr (not a pipe), which is what raw-mode
   attach needs. `list` and every `attach` failure branch reachable without a
   live tmux server (no id given, no socket for the id, no `tmux` on `PATH`)
   are tested against a fake `systemctl`; the full-screen terminal handoff
   itself is a documented manual check — `systemctl --user list-units
   'arb-session-*' --no-legend` and `tmux -S $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/arbiter/session-
   <id>.sock attach [-r] -t coord` are the raw commands underneath it, and
   verifying `arb session attach <id>` behaves the same with
   `systemctl --user stop arbiter` first is the check to run on the live host.
   `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` unset is a hard `die` naming the real cause (a systemd
   user session, not `/tmp`) rather than deriving a socket path the server
   side (`Arbiter.Sessions.Naming.runtime_dir/0`) could never itself have
   produced.

## 5. Transport and protocol (research task 2)

### 5.1 Channel, not LiveView hook-only

A **Phoenix Channel** on a dedicated socket, with the LiveView page rendering
chrome (HUD, controls) and a colocated hook owning the terminal element.

LiveView's diffing is the wrong tool for a 60 fps ANSI byte stream: every frame
would become a diff against an element the hook is mutating anyway (which is why
it must carry `phx-update="ignore"`). A Channel gives a raw binary path, its own
backpressure, and — importantly — a topic keyed to the session id rather than to a
LiveView process, so a browser reload reattaches to the same session without
re-mounting terminal state.

`arbiter_web` has **no user socket today** (only `/live` and live-reload), so this
is new but small: one `socket "/session"` entry in `endpoint.ex` plus one channel
module.

### 5.2 Message envelope

Deliberately provider-neutral: nothing below mentions Claude. A terminal is bytes,
a size, and a lifecycle.

**Client → server**

| Event | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `join` | `%{session_id, last_seq \| nil, cols, rows}` | `last_seq` requests resume; `nil` requests full snapshot |
| `stdin` | `{:binary, bytes}` | raw bytes, never JSON-wrapped — no UTF-8 mangling of partial sequences |
| `resize` | `%{cols, rows}` | debounced client-side (~100 ms) |
| `redraw` | `%{}` | make the agent repaint; a SIGWINCH nudge, not a pane command (bd-14b11h) |
| `detach` | `%{}` | leave the session running; server drops the reader |
| `kill` | `%{confirm: true}` | terminate the agent; scope self-reaps |
| `ping` | `%{ts}` | liveness/RTT for the HUD |

**Server → client**

| Event | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `snapshot` | `%{seq, data}` | ANSI-preserving scrollback replay on (re)attach |
| `stdout` | `{:binary, bytes}` with `seq` in metadata | live PTY output |
| `exit` | `%{code, reason}` | agent exited; session row closes |
| `meta` | `%{cols, rows, attached_clients, title}` | reconciles a resize done by another client |
| `usage` | `%{tokens_in, tokens_out, cache_creation, cache_read, cost_usd, model}` | HUD feed (§7.5) |
| `error` | `%{code, detail}` | e.g. `:session_gone`, `:bridge_unavailable` |

`stdin`/`stdout` are **binary frames**. Everything else is JSON. A terminal stream
splits multi-byte UTF-8 and escape sequences across reads; decoding at the
transport corrupts them. Decode only in xterm.js, which reassembles by design.

### 5.3 Sequence numbers, resume, and backpressure

Every `stdout` frame carries a monotonic `seq` per session. The server keeps a
bounded ring (suggest 2 MB) of recent frames.

- **Reconnect within the ring** → client sends `last_seq`, server replays
  `last_seq+1..current`. Seamless; no repaint.
- **Reconnect outside the ring** (or first join) → server sends `snapshot` from
  `capture-pane` and resets the client's sequence. Cheap and always correct.

This is why resume is keyed to **session id + seq**, not to a socket: a flaky
connection, a laptop sleeping, and an arbiter restart are all the same event to
the client.

**Backpressure.** A browser on a slow link cannot keep up with a build log. Phoenix
channels buffer per-socket, so the naive version grows the BEAM's heap until
something dies. Instead:

1. The reader reads `pipe-pane` output in chunks and **coalesces** — if more bytes
   arrive while a push is in flight, concatenate rather than enqueue.
2. Above a high-water mark (suggest 256 KB pending), **drop to snapshot mode**:
   discard the backlog, push one `capture-pane` snapshot, resume live. A terminal's
   value is its *current* contents; showing the user the present instantly beats
   replaying a backlog they will scroll past. The full byte stream is preserved in
   the transcript regardless (§11), so nothing is actually lost.
3. `stdin` needs no backpressure — human typing is orders of magnitude slower than
   any PTY.

### 5.4 Staying provider-agnostic (decision 7)

The envelope above contains no provider concept, and this is the whole trick:
**a PTY session is provider-agnostic by construction** because a terminal is bytes.
Provider differences live entirely in two places outside the transport:

1. **Launch spec** — argv, env, config dir, per-provider flags. A behaviour
   (`Arbiter.Sessions.Provider`) with `launch_spec/1`, mirroring how
   `Arbiter.MCP.AgentConfig` already fans out to per-agent writers.
2. **Usage ingestion** — each CLI records usage differently. `agy`/gemini and
   codex have their own on-disk formats (`docs/session-archive.md` notes both
   exist and, unlike Claude Code, are not pruned). The behaviour gains
   `usage_source/1`; §7.6 covers the shape.

`Arbiter.Usage.ClaudeSessionFile`'s moduledoc already states the precedent —
"deliberately Claude-Code-specific — no multi-provider `Provider` behaviour until
a second provider actually needs one (bd-au3xrq)". This RFC does **not** propose
building the behaviour now. It proposes not putting provider knowledge in the
envelope, so that adding one later is additive.

### 5.5 Status — phase 4 shipped (bd-3ymdvi, #1685)

The transport is implemented. Six things in §5 were under-specified or wrong
and were decided while building it; they are recorded here rather than left
for the next reader to rediscover.

**1. `seq` is framed into the payload, because there is no metadata.**
§5.2 describes `stdout` as "`{:binary, bytes}` with `seq` in metadata". A
Phoenix binary push is `{:binary, iodata}` and the WebSocket frame carries the
payload and nothing else — no event name, no ref, no headers. Since §5.3's
resume is keyed on session id + seq, the number has to be in the bytes:

```
<<"ARB1", seq::unsigned-big-64, payload::binary>>
```

`Arbiter.Sessions.Frame` prefixes and strips; it never looks at the payload,
which is what keeps a split `\e[1;31m` or a split `🚀` byte-exact. Both
directions use it — a client's stdin seq is what lets the server drop stdin
a reconnecting client re-sent, rather than typing it into the pane twice.

**2. One reader per session, not per attached client.** §4.3 says "one reader
per attached browser". tmux makes that impossible: `pipe-pane` is a property
of the pane, singular — issuing it twice replaces the first pipe. It is also
the wrong shape for §5.3, which wants one `seq` space and one ring *per
session* so two clients resuming from different points are talking about the
same numbers. The property §4.3 actually cares about is untouched: an `arbiter`
restart drops the reader, never the session. A detach does not even drop the
reader — it keeps running, unattended, for as long as the session does, since
it is also what owns §11's raw capture (bd-5pelo2, round 2).

**3. `seq` is a byte offset into the pipe file, not a counter.** This falls
out of `pipe-pane -O 'cat >> <path>'` and is the most useful invariant in the
phase. Resume arithmetic becomes `pread(file, last_seq, head - last_seq)`; the
in-memory ring becomes a fast path that preserves frame boundaries rather than
the source of truth; and a reconnect after an `arbiter` restart is **gapless**
rather than a repaint, because the `cat` tmux spawned lives in the *session's*
scope, keeps appending while arbiter is dead, and a new reader picks the
numbering back up from the file size. §12 item 7's ring size therefore matters
less than it looked: outside the ring is not automatically a repaint.

**4. Resize: last writer wins** (§12 item 8, which suggested "first client
owns size, others letterbox"). The most recent `resize` from any attached
client sets the pane size and every client is sent `meta`. This matches tmux's
own `window-size latest`, needs no size-ownership handover when the owning
client leaves, and is compatible with the suggestion — letterboxing is a
frontend response to `meta`, which phase 5 can add without the transport
having an opinion.

**5. The client must reconnect on a *clean* close — phase 5 needs this line.**
`phoenix.js` deliberately does not reconnect after WebSocket close code `1000`
(normal closure), and a graceful `systemctl --user restart arbiter` produces
exactly that: Bandit closes every socket with 1000 on shutdown before the BEAM
exits. For a terminal client that is the wrong reading. The session *outlives*
the server by design (§4.3), so a clean server close means "back shortly", not
"stop watching this terminal" — without an override, the tab goes dead on
every deploy and decision 3's gapless resume never gets a chance to run. One
line in the socket's `onClose` fixes it:

```js
if (code === 1000) socket.reconnectTimer.scheduleTimeout()
```

This was found, not reasoned about: the first run of
`ArbiterWeb.SessionTransportSocketTest` hung at "socket closed at seq 19 (code
1000)" and never rejoined. Phase 5's hook must carry the same line, and its
rejoin params must be a **closure** — `phoenix.js` only re-evaluates join
params that are a function, so an object literal silently resumes from the
`last_seq` the tab first connected with rather than the newest one.

**6. A joining client is guaranteed its `snapshot` before any live frame.**
§5.2 lists the events but says nothing about their order at join, and the
obvious implementation gets it wrong: the reader registers the new subscriber
*inside* the attach call, so its next poll can deliver a live frame to the
channel before the channel has queued its own post-join flush. The client then
sees a frame at `seq` newer than the snapshot, followed by the snapshot — and
repaints backwards over bytes it has already drawn. The channel therefore
holds anything that arrives in that window and drains it, in order, right
after the snapshot or replay. Phase 5's client may rely on this: after a
successful `join`, the first thing on the wire is always `snapshot` or the
replay frames.

Backpressure is §5.3 item 2 as written: each client acknowledges the bytes it
has pushed onto the wire, a client past the high-water mark stops receiving
frames and keeps no backlog, and one `capture-pane` snapshot repaints it when
its acknowledgements catch up.

One limit of that, so phase 5 does not assume more than is there: the
acknowledgement is sent the moment a frame is handed to `push/3`, which returns
as soon as the message reaches the transport process. The high-water mark
therefore bounds the **channel process's** mailbox, not the Bandit connection
process's send queue, which is where a genuinely slow *network* client's bytes
would pile up. That is the right first cut — it is the queue the reader can see
and the one AC 4 asks about — but a socket-level bound is still unbuilt.

Tested headlessly: `Arbiter.Sessions.StreamTest` and
`ArbiterWeb.SessionChannelTest` run against a scripted PTY that appends to the
same kind of file tmux writes, so the byte path under test is the real one.
`Arbiter.Integration.SessionTmuxTest` runs the same operations against a real
tmux server on a scratch socket — cheap enough for the default suite, skipped
only where tmux is absent.

Tested over a real socket, too. `ArbiterWeb.SessionTransportSocketTest` stands
the endpoint up on a real port under Bandit and drives it with
`scripts/verify_session_transport.mjs` — the same `phoenix.js` the dashboard
ships, run under Node's built-in `WebSocket` (no npm; §6.1). It stops the
listener *and* the reader, lets the pane keep writing to the pipe file while
both are down, brings them back, and asserts the client's own verdict:

```
joined (#1): {"mode":"snapshot","seq":0}
before-the-restart
socket closed at seq 19 (code 1000) — will resume
joined (#2): {"mode":"resumed","seq":37}
during-the-outage
RESULT: PASS — frames=3 bytes=55 seq=55 reconnects=1 gaps=0 duplicates=0
```

That script is also the instrument for AC 8 on the live host: point it at a
real session, `systemctl --user restart arbiter`, and read the same summary
line.

## 6. Frontend (research task 3)

### 6.1 The constraint nobody expects: there is no npm

`apps/arbiter_web/assets` has **no `package.json` and no `node_modules`**.
`config/config.exs:160` runs esbuild directly over `js/app.js`, and third-party JS
is **vendored** as source (`assets/vendor/topbar.js`, `daisyui.js`, …).

So "add `@xterm/xterm`" is not `npm i`. Options:

- **Vendor the built ESM bundle** into `assets/vendor/xterm/` and import it
  relatively, exactly as `topbar` is imported (`import topbar from
  "../vendor/topbar"` — `app.js:26`). Consistent with the repo, no new toolchain,
  reviewable diff, pinned by construction. Downside: a ~300 KB vendored artifact
  in git and manual upgrades.
- **Introduce `package.json`** for this one dependency. Cleaner upgrades, but adds
  an npm install step to every build, CI and worker worktree — a real cost across
  a fleet that creates worktrees constantly.

**Recommendation: vendor it**, and record the upstream version in a header comment.
One dependency does not justify a package manager on every worktree. Revisit if a
second JS dependency appears. Note xterm also ships **CSS** (`xterm.css`) which
must be vendored into `assets/css/` and imported from `app.css`.

### 6.2 Renderer: canvas, not WebGL

**`@xterm/addon-canvas`.** Justification specific to this app:

- The WebGL addon is faster on large, fast-scrolling output, but it consumes a
  WebGL context. Browsers cap live contexts (~8–16); the Arbiter dashboard is a
  multi-panel app the operator keeps open across tabs, and decision 2 asks for
  **multiple concurrent sessions**. Several terminals plus any future chart is
  exactly the shape that hits context loss, which manifests as a blank terminal —
  an awful failure for the primary interface.
- WebGL needs explicit `onContextLoss` handling and a renderer rebuild. Canvas
  degrades gracefully and needs none.
- The workload is an interactive agent session — human-paced turns, not
  `yes` piped to a terminal. Canvas is comfortably sufficient.

Keep the DOM renderer as automatic fallback; xterm falls back on its own if canvas
construction fails.

### 6.3 Interaction details

- **Copy/paste.** Enable `macOptionIsMeta: false` and rely on xterm's default
  selection; bind `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+C/V` via `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` so plain
  `Ctrl+C` still sends `SIGINT` to the agent — the single most common terminal
  papercut. Paste goes through `navigator.clipboard.readText()`; large pastes are
  chunked into `stdin` frames.
- **Narrow widths.** A terminal cannot reflow meaningfully below ~80 columns. Do
  not pretend: below the breakpoint, render the terminal in a horizontally
  scrollable container at a fixed 80 columns rather than shrinking the font to
  illegibility. Mobile is a *monitoring* surface — for real AFK work the answer is
  Remote Control (§8), which gives a purpose-built mobile UI for free. That is a
  design decision worth making explicitly rather than shipping a bad phone
  terminal.
- **Scrollback.** Set xterm `scrollback: 5000` client-side. The server holds 30k
  lines (§4.5) and the transcript holds everything (§11); the client only needs
  what the operator will actually scroll.
- **Cost HUD.** Pin it **outside** the xterm element — a slim bar above or beside
  it, in the LiveView, fed by the `usage` channel event. Overlaying it on the
  terminal would fight `FitAddon` for rows and shift reflow on every update. The
  HUD is LiveView-rendered (cheap, infrequent), the terminal is hook-owned
  (`phx-update="ignore"`); they never contend.
- **Fit.** `FitAddon` on a `ResizeObserver`, debounced, emitting `resize`. The
  *mount* fit is not the observer's: it measures until the pane has a box and
  the hook joins only then (bd-14b11h). A LiveView navigation mounts the hook
  inside the DOM patch, where the pane can still be 0x0, and the geometry a
  mount brings is what the join resizes the shared pane to — xterm's 80x24
  construction default is not a safe thing to send. When the join reply says it
  *did* resize the pane, the snapshot that came with it was reflowed by the pane
  rather than redrawn by the agent, so the client asks for a `redraw`.

The repo already has the colocated-hook precedent for terminal-ish UI:
`.LogStreamStick` in `core_components/domain.ex:578` does scroll-pinning for the
live worker log. The session hook is the same pattern, one level up.

### 6.4 Status — phase 5 shipped (bd-c76fu9)

The browser terminal is live at `/sessions` (list), linked from the global nav
between Loop and Usage — and, since the session dock's phase 2/3, in the dock
strip on *every* page. `/sessions/:id` no longer exists; see §6.5.

| §6 item | Where it landed |
|---|---|
| 6.1 vendor, no npm | `apps/arbiter_web/assets/vendor/xterm/` + `assets/css/xterm.css`, imported from `app.css`. Provenance, digests and upgrade steps in that directory's `README.md`; `ArbiterWeb.TerminalAssetsTest` fails if a `package.json` appears or a version drifts |
| 6.2 canvas, not WebGL | `assets/js/session_terminal.mjs` loads `CanvasAddon`; the same test greps the asset tree for `addon-webgl` |
| 6.3 interaction | copy/paste, scrollback 5000, the narrow-width floor and the fit debounce, all in `session_terminal.mjs` |
| the hook | `.SessionTerminal`, colocated in `ArbiterWeb.SessionDockLive` — it moved there from `SessionLive` with the session dock's phase 2 (bd-9myzv8), so the terminal outlives the page the operator opened it from |
| the protocol | `assets/js/session_stream.mjs` — DOM-free on purpose (below) |
| the fit | `assets/js/session_fit.mjs` — DOM-free, replaces `addon-fit` (bd-3r2otb) |
| copy/paste | `assets/js/session_keys.mjs` — DOM-free (bd-3r2otb) |
| page chrome | `ArbiterWeb.SessionIndexLive` (the index) and the dock's own window chrome in `ArbiterWeb.SessionDockLive` (everything per-session) |

**The canvas addon pins the terminal version.** Upstream shipped
`@xterm/xterm@6.0.0` on 2025-12-22 alongside new `addon-webgl`, `addon-search`,
`addon-web-links` and `addon-fit` releases — and **no new `addon-canvas`**. Its
last release is still `0.7.0` (2024-04-05), declaring
`peerDependencies: {"@xterm/xterm": "^5.0.0"}`. The addon reaches deep into
`terminal._core`, so running it against a major version it was never built for
risks throwing out of `loadAddon` and leaving no terminal at all. §6.2 chose
canvas on failure-mode grounds that have not changed, so the vendored set is
the 5.x line: `xterm@5.5.0` + `addon-canvas@0.7.0`. That
line publishes only the UMD/CJS build (the `.mjs` bundles first appear in 6.0.0
and in 5.6.0 *betas*); esbuild consumes it and emits ESM, so nothing downstream
can tell. Revisit when upstream ships a canvas addon for 6.x.

**The protocol is a separate, DOM-free module.** The parts of a terminal client
that are easy to get subtly wrong — the `last_seq` rejoin closure, duplicate
suppression on resume, binary stdin framing, the debounced resize — are exactly
the parts a browser makes untestable. They live in `session_stream.mjs`, which
`apps/arbiter_web/test/js/session_stream_test.mjs` drives under `node --test`
and which `scripts/verify_session_transport.mjs` now drives over a real socket
**instead of reimplementing the protocol a second time**. So §5.5's resume
proof and §6's browser client are the same code, not two readings of the same
spec.

**One phoenix.js trap, carried over from phase 4.** A graceful
`systemctl --user restart arbiter` closes every WebSocket with code `1000`, and
phoenix.js deliberately does not reconnect after a normal closure. For a
session that outlives the server by design (§4.3) that is the wrong reading, so
the hook schedules the reconnect itself. Without it §10.1's headline experience
— restart arbiter, the terminal comes back — silently does not happen.

#### What was verified, and how

`scripts/verify_session_terminal.mjs` bundles the *real* `createSessionTerminal`
with the esbuild binary the `esbuild` Mix package already installed and runs it
inside a headless Chromium over the DevTools Protocol — no npm, no Playwright,
no new dependency. `ArbiterWeb.SessionTerminalBrowserTest` runs it as part of
`mix test` wherever a browser is on disk, and skips loudly where one is not.

**Paste goes through `Terminal.paste()`, never around it.** The first
implementation sent the clipboard string straight down the stdin path, which
passed a single-line probe and would have failed every real paste: xterm is
what normalizes `\r\n`/`\n` to `\r` (a raw-mode TUI reads CR as Enter and does
nothing with LF) and what wraps the text in `ESC[200~`/`ESC[201~` when the app
has enabled bracketed paste, so a pasted multi-line prompt is inserted as one
block rather than submitted line by line. The handler also has to
`preventDefault()`: Chrome and Firefox bind `Ctrl+Shift+V` themselves and will
otherwise deliver the same text a second time through the helper textarea.
The clipboard the probe reads is multi-line for exactly this reason, and it
counts the frames.

Resume is proved separately and end-to-end by
`ArbiterWeb.SessionTransportSocketTest`, which takes the listener *and* the
reader down, keeps writing to the pipe file while both are gone, brings them
back, and reads the tally off the browser's own engine:
`RESULT: PASS — frames=3 bytes=55 seq=55 reconnects=1 gaps=0 duplicates=0`.

Narrow widths are a two-part check because they are a two-part claim: the page
must not scroll sideways (`#session-dock-scroller-<id>` is `overflow-x-auto`,
asserted in `ArbiterWeb.SessionDockLiveTest`) and the pane must keep a floor
width wide enough
to be a terminal (`min-w-[640px]`, measured at **89 columns** in the browser
check above).

#### Left to later phases, deliberately

* The **cost HUD** is phase 7. §6.3's rule that it sits *outside* the xterm
  element is already satisfied by the status strip's position and by
  `phx-update="ignore"` over the pane.
* The **pre-launch options UI** is phase 11. Launch here takes no options and
  uses the guardrail defaults: mode B, cross-workspace, `can_dispatch` **off**.
* **Multiple concurrent terminals on one page** are not exercised. The hook is
  per-element and holds no module state, so nothing prevents it; it is simply
  not a shape phase 5 ships a page for.

### 6.5 The session dock, and the end of `/sessions/:id` (phase 3, bd-a292yj)

The dock epic (bd-dlc136 phase 1, bd-9myzv8 phase 2, bd-a292yj phase 3,
bd-cdut29 phase 4) moved the terminal — and then everything around it — out
of a page and into a strip pinned to the bottom of every dashboard page.
Phase 3 finished the move and executed the decision it left open.

**`/sessions/:id` is gone, route and all.** Once `keep_alive`, Detach, Kill,
the metadata and the cost figure live in a dock window, keeping the page would
mean two surfaces owning the same controls, and two surfaces that own the same
control drift. The alternative — a route that still exists but whose controls
have moved away — is the worst of the three. So the page was deleted along with
`ArbiterWeb.SessionLive` and its tests; `apps/arbiter_web/lib/arbiter_web/router.ex`
carries a comment saying why, so it does not come back by accident.

| control | owner |
|---|---|
| the terminal, `keep_alive`, Detach, session metadata, ledger cost/tokens, the end reason | the dock window (`ArbiterWeb.SessionDockLive`) |
| name at launch, the full history, reviewing sessions that ended long ago | `/sessions` (`ArbiterWeb.SessionIndexLive`) |
| Kill | **both**, deliberately — ending a session is a fleet act and a window act. One implementation: `SessionIndexLive.kill_modal/1`, rendered by both views, and both keep the confirm step |
| launch | **both**, deliberately (phase 4, bd-cdut29) — the dock roster's **New session** control needs the same launch options without leaving the current page. One implementation: `SessionIndexLive.launch_form/1` and `launch_defaults/1`, rendered/called by both views, so `/sessions`' launch path and the dock's stay a single code path rather than two that can drift |

Kill's confirmation matters *more* in the dock than it did on the page: a title
bar that is on screen everywhere is a different risk profile from a page an
operator navigated to on purpose.

Detach is not a second implementation of anything. "Drop this browser's reader,
leave the agent running" is exactly what collapsing a window already does — the
pane is unmounted, which disposes the xterm and closes its `/session` socket —
so the overflow item routes into the same `collapse` handler under the name an
operator comes looking for.

**An ended session's window stays, read-only, until dismissed.** The last
output is most interesting exactly when the session dies, and auto-closing
throws it away. So an end does not unmount the pane (unmounting is what
disposes the xterm): it *freezes* it. `data-readonly` reaches the
`phx-update="ignore"` element — LiveView merges `data-*` attributes onto
ignored nodes and then runs the hook's `updated()`, which is the only channel
the server has into a subtree it is otherwise forbidden to touch — the hook
calls the terminal's `setReadOnly`, and `SessionStream` had already refused
stdin from the moment the channel reported `exit`. A frozen window keeps its
pane through a collapse too (hidden, not removed): "until dismissed" means what
it says. Dismissing is the one act that throws the scrollback away, and it
takes the window out of the persisted `localStorage` state with it.

A **LiveView rejoin** is the one thing the pane cannot ride out by itself, and
the live check is what found it: a rejoin re-runs the dock's `mount/3`, renders
it empty, and that patch destroys every window element — and every xterm in one
— before `restore` puts them back. A live pane recovers by replaying its stream
from `last_seq`; a dead one has no stream left. So the client keeps which
sessions are frozen and the text their panes held, in memory next to the resume
book, `restore` carries the frozen list (re-validated like the rest of that
payload — it must be an open window whose row is genuinely over), and a pane
rebuilt frozen opens no socket at all: it is painted from the kept text and
says out loud that the styling did not survive. `scripts/verify_session_page.mjs`
asserts the whole sequence in a real browser — kill, read-only with the
scrollback, drop and re-join the socket, still there, then dismiss.

**A session that ended before this browser session: replay the file**
(bd-3tf4oo, #1818). It has no scrollback in this browser, but phase 9 persists
its raw PTY capture, so that is what its window shows — read-only, ANSI intact,
through the same seam a live pane uses rather than a second renderer:

    Arbiter.Sessions.TranscriptReplay.read_tail/2     the bounded tail of the file
      -> SessionChannel join with mode: "transcript"  same topic, no reader started
      -> push "snapshot"                              the same event a live attach sends
      -> SessionStream repaint -> xterm               the same renderer

`TranscriptReplay.describe/2` is what the dock asks first, and it is also what
makes the empty case honest: a missing file is `:retention_deleted` (the sweep
took it — the session ended longer ago than the retention window),
`:never_captured` (it predates capture, or its reader never started) or
`:empty`, and the window names which, links the archived session JSONL when one
exists, and never renders a blank terminal. A transcript over the replay cap is
shown as a tail, with "showing last N of M" and a download link to the whole
file (`ArbiterWeb.SessionTranscriptController`, loopback-only like the socket).
That controller serves both of a finished session's artefacts:
`/sessions/:id/transcript` is the raw PTY capture this section is about, and
`/sessions/:id/jsonl` is the phase 9 session archive, decompressed — the same
route the issue detail page's refine "Transcript" link uses (bd-cvfjms). Both
derive the served path from a looked-up session row, never from the URL.

Nothing about it is presented as live: no status strip, no reconnect (the
client hangs up once the bytes are painted), and stdin, resize, redraw and kill
are refused on the channel with `read_only`. Note also that the replayed bytes
were laid out by the pane at the geometry it had when they were written, not at
this window's — another reason the chrome says "transcript" rather than
implying a live screen. `/sessions` ended rows say **View transcript** and open
this same window; it is an entry point, not a second viewer.

## 7. Metering and attribution (research task 4)

### 7.1 Recommendation

**Ingest the session's own Claude Code JSONL.** Tail it live for the HUD; reconcile
at session end; write `Usage.Event` rows with `source: :coordinator_session` and
`session_id`.

### 7.2 Evidence, including the critical-path result (AC 10c)

Measured against the operator's real, already-existing bridged session —
a genuine mode B + `--remote-control` session, which is exactly the configuration
Amendment 2 flagged as critical path.

**The JSONL carries dollars, not just tokens.** A `cost-state` record
(token-free sample, real shape):

```json
{"type":"cost-state","sessionId":"…","totalCostUSD":9.777289,
 "totalAPIDuration":350343,"totalDuration":668525,"startTime":1788556943788,
 "modelUsage":{"claude-opus-5[1m]":{
    "inputTokens":1048,"outputTokens":24032,"thinkingTokens":10936,
    "cacheReadInputTokens":9410278,"cacheCreationInputTokens":446611,
    "webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":9.777289}},
 "hasUnknownModelCost":false}
```

**Remote Control is visible in the same file** as `bridge-session` records:

```json
{"type":"bridge-session","sessionId":"…","bridgeSessionId":"cse_01Srk…",
 "lastSequenceNum":0,"ownerAccountUuid":"…","ownerOrganizationUuid":"…"}
```

**The critical-path measurement.** Within that one session:

| Measurement | Value |
|---|---|
| `bridge-session` records | **546**, one distinct `bridgeSessionId`, spanning lines 3 → 14543 |
| assistant records carrying `usage` **inside the bridged window** | **4,216** |
| `cost-state` records inside the bridged window | **16** |
| `totalCostUSD` across the bridged window | **$9.78 → $325.78** |

Interleaving confirms it turn-by-turn — `usage` records appear immediately before
and after each `bridge-session` record, continuously.

**Conclusion: proxy-free metering works in mode B with Remote Control active.**
Turns driven from claude.ai still record usage and cost locally, because the model
calls still originate from the local CLI process; the bridge only carries operator
input in and rendered output out. **No blocking finding.**

One corroborating detail: consecutive records repeat identical totals (e.g.
`424072` three times), the streaming re-emit duplication that
`ClaudeSessionFile`'s moduledoc documents and `read_totals/2` already dedupes by
`message.id`. Independent confirmation that the existing reader's central gotcha
is real and correctly handled.

### 7.3 Alternatives evaluated

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **JSONL ingestion** (recommended) | Works today, in both auth modes, with Remote Control, with **no launch-time configuration the session could omit**. Carries tokens *and* dollars *and* per-model breakdown. ~80% of the reader already exists. |
| **Reintroduce a proxy for sessions** | **Rejected.** #1605 removed it deliberately; re-adding it for data already on disk is a regression. It would also need `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in the session env — a single misconfiguration silently unmeters a session, the exact failure this feature exists to fix. It is *more* fragile than the file, not less. Worth noting it also fails on a technicality: it cannot see cache-read/cache-write split pricing decisions the CLI makes, and would force us to re-derive cost the CLI already computed. |
| **Claude Code OpenTelemetry export** | **Rejected for now.** Claude Code can export OTel metrics, but it needs a collector endpoint configured at launch (same silent-misconfiguration risk as the proxy), adds an infrastructure dependency Arbiter does not otherwise have, and is aggregate-oriented. Reasonable *later* as a cross-provider unifier; not the first implementation. |
| **`CloudProbe` / `/api/oauth/usage`** | **Not viable.** Account-level utilisation percentages, not per-session tokens (#1602). It answers "how close to the cap", not "what did this session cost". Complementary, not a substitute. |
| **Parse the rendered terminal output** | **Rejected.** Scraping `/cost` output is brittle and only available on demand. |

### 7.4 Schema — extend #1596, do not re-propose it

The schema is already correct. Required changes are small:

1. **Write rows.** New `Arbiter.Sessions.UsageIngest` creates `Usage.Event` with
   `source: :coordinator_session`, `session_id: <arbiter session id>`,
   `task_id: nil`. No migration needed for the discriminator — `:66` already lists
   it.
2. **Cost.** `cost_usd` from `cost-state.totalCostUSD` (delta since last row).
   This **corrects a documented limitation**: `ClaudeSessionFile`'s moduledoc says
   the on-disk data carries "no per-turn dollar figure … so a reconciled row
   records deduped token counts with `cost_usd` left `nil`". That is true of
   `assistant` lines and **false of the file as a whole** — `cost-state` lines
   carry `totalCostUSD` and per-model `costUSD`. Extending the reader to parse
   `cost-state` therefore improves *worker* reconciliation too, not just sessions.
   Prompt-cache pricing needs no new arithmetic: the CLI has already applied the
   cache-write/cache-read price split, and the ledger already has
   `cache_creation_tokens`/`cache_read_tokens` (`:176`/`:180`) to record the
   buckets alongside it. **Reuse the CLI's number; do not recompute it.**
3. **One index.** `Usage.Event` indexes `[:source, :occurred_at]` (`:79`). Add
   `[:session_id]` for `--by session` to be cheap.
4. **A `sessions` table** (the new entity) — id, provider, workspace binding,
   scope unit, tmux socket, config dir, cwd, provider session id, auth mode,
   remote-control flag, `started_at`/`ended_at`, `last_client_at`. `Usage.Event`
   references it by the existing `session_id` string; no FK churn.

### 7.5 Live HUD and end-of-session reconciliation

**Live (cheap, approximate).** A tailer follows the JSONL with a file watcher,
parses appended lines, and pushes `usage` channel events. `cost-state` records are
periodic, so between them the HUD shows token deltas and the last known cost. Push
on a timer (~2 s) rather than per line — a busy turn appends dozens of records and
the HUD does not need 30 Hz.

**Authoritative (at session end, and periodically).** Re-read the file with
`read_totals/2` semantics — dedupe by `message.id`, honour `:since` — and write the
reconciled row. This is the same reconcile-from-disk pattern
`Arbiter.Usage.ClaudeSessionFile` already exists to perform for crashed workers;
sessions are just a longer-lived instance of the same problem.

Two wrinkles the reader already anticipates:
- **`:since` is load-bearing.** A resumed session appends to the same file, so
  every ingest must be windowed to avoid re-billing. `read_totals/2` takes
  `:since` for exactly this reason.
- **Rollover.** A long session hitting `--resume`/compaction may change session
  ids; `locate/2` globs by session id, so the session row must track the
  *current* provider session id, not just the launch one.

### 7.6 `arb usage` gains a session dimension

Already present from #1596: `--by source` and `--source coordinator_session`.
Missing, and the actual ask:

```
arb usage --by session [--since 7d]      # one row per session: cost, tokens, duration
arb usage --session <id>                 # the event detail view, scoped to one session
```

`--by session` must show *only* session-sourced rows (`task_id` is nil for them),
mirroring how `--by task` already "deliberately **excludes**" sessionful sources
"rather than inventing a phantom task id"
(`apps/arbiter_cli/lib/arbiter_cli/cmd/usage.ex:32`). Add `session` to the `--by`
list at `:13` and a `session` filter alongside `source:` at `:98`.

With that, the §1 table closes: the $325.78 session appears in `arb usage --by
session` and in the `--by day` totals it currently falsifies.

### 7.7 Status — phase 6 shipped (bd-be804c, #1651)

Items 1–3 of §7.4 and the "authoritative" half of §7.5 are implemented and
metering today's **CLI** coordinator, ahead of the session lifecycle, transport
and UI phases. What shipped:

  * `Arbiter.Usage.ClaudeSessionFile` parses `cost-state`, so `read_totals/2`
    now returns `cost_usd` / `model_costs` / `duration_ms` alongside the token
    buckets. Both worker reconciliation paths (`Arbiter.Worker`'s in-process
    fallback and `Arbiter.Workers.Reconciler`'s boot sweep) write a real dollar
    figure instead of `nil`.
  * `Arbiter.Sessions.UsageIngest` sweeps the directories named by
    `ARBITER_COORDINATOR_SESSION_DIRS` every 5 minutes and writes
    `source: :coordinator_session` rows. Default is empty — metering someone's
    `~/.claude` is opt-in.
  * `usage_events.session_id` is indexed, so §7.6's `--by session` is cheap
    when phase 7 adds it.

Three things the implementation found that §7.2's sample does not show, all now
encoded in `ClaudeSessionFile`:

  1. **`cost-state` carries no `timestamp`.** It has `startTime` (epoch ms, the
     CLI *process* start), which is what `:since` windows it by.
  2. **`totalCostUSD` is not monotonic across a file.** It is cumulative within
     one CLI process and **restarts at zero when a new process opens the same
     file** — a real session reads `… 47.41 → 6.63 → 121.02 …`. The file total is
     therefore `sum over startTime segments of max(totalCostUSD)`; maxing the
     whole file would have silently dropped every pre-resume segment.
  3. **Rollover needs a per-line guard, not just `:since`.** A session that rolls
     onto a new id copies the parent's lines into the new file, and the copies
     keep the *parent's* `sessionId`. `read_totals/2` takes `:session_id` and
     skips lines stamped with a different one.

Phase 7 (the live HUD tailer and `arb usage --by session` / `--session <id>`)
shipped separately — see §7.9.

### 7.8 Post-deploy corrections — what the live run found (bd-be804c, follow-up)

Phase 6 shipped, the coordinator restarted with
`ARBITER_COORDINATOR_SESSION_DIRS` set, and the first live sweep exposed two
defects that no fixture could have predicted. Both are fixed; both changed
assumptions §7.4 states, so they are recorded here rather than in a commit
message.

**1. `cost-state` records are gone in Claude Code 2.1.270.** §7.2's sample and
every fixture came from 2.1.246–2.1.269, which wrote them every few hundred
lines. The 2.1.270 session that was *live at the time of the deploy* — 3,018
lines — contains **zero**, so the authoritative-cost path never fired and every
row landed with `cost_usd: nil`. Six-figure token counts next to no dollars
read as a broken parser, which is worse than the gap phase 6 set out to close.

The fix keeps §7.4's "reuse the CLI's number, don't recompute" rule as the
*first* choice and adds a labelled fallback:
`Arbiter.Usage.ClaudePricing` prices the deduped token buckets at published
list rates when — and only when — the file carries no `cost-state`.
`read_totals/2` reports `cost_source: :cost_state | :estimated | nil`, and
`cost_note_for/1` gives every writer the matching note, so a derived figure is
never mistaken for the CLI's own. An unpriceable model still yields an
explained null. This applies to worker reconciliation too: a worker run on
2.1.270+ now gets a cost instead of a hole.

**2. `occurred_at` must come from the transcript, not the clock.** The first
implementation dated rows `DateTime.utc_now()`. That is within 5 minutes of the
truth in steady state and badly wrong on the first pass: a session that has
been appending since 2026-09-04 had its entire history (16 rows, $739.08 on
the dogfood host) filed on the day the sweeper first ran, falsifying the very
`--by day` column §7.6 promises to fix.

`ClaudeSessionFile` now also splits a file into **UTC-day buckets** — per-day
token counts, per-day message count, the newest turn timestamp in the day, and
that day's apportioned share of the file's one authoritative cost figure (the
total is split, never recomputed). `UsageIngest` writes one row per
(session, day) and dates it at the day's last turn, with the ledger watermark
now read per day, so a delta spanning midnight becomes two correctly dated rows
and a re-run still writes nothing. The rows from the mis-dating deploy are
deleted by
`priv/repo/migrations/20260914060000_redate_coordinator_session_usage.exs` —
they are derived data, so the next sweep re-derives them, on the right days and
with costs.

### 7.9 Status — phase 7 shipped (bd-67l88l)

The two items §7.7 left open are done:

  * **Live HUD tailer.** `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream` — the same one-reader-per-
    session process that already fans out terminal bytes (§5.3) — gained a
    second timer (`usage_poll_interval_ms`, default ~2s) that, while at least
    one client is attached, re-reads the session's JSONL with
    `ClaudeSessionFile.read_totals/2` and publishes the file's **cumulative**
    totals (not a delta since the last tick) on `Sessions.usage_topic/1` — a
    tab that attaches midway through the session, or reattaches after the
    reader restarted, shows the correct number on the very next tick instead
    of resuming from zero. `cost_usd` is the file's latest cumulative figure,
    since `cost-state` records are periodic (or, on 2.1.270+, absent entirely
    — see §7.7); `estimated` is `cost_source == :estimated` — true only when
    the figure came from `ClaudePricing`'s token-based estimate, not merely
    "not a `cost-state` record" (a file with no cost at all reports
    `cost_usd: nil`, `estimated: false`). `ArbiterWeb.SessionChannel` was
    already subscribed to that topic and forwarding it (phase 4's
    placeholder), so no channel change was needed. The hook-owned status strip
    renders a running token/cost chip from it, the same way it already renders
    geometry from `meta` events — never a LiveView diff. (That strip was on
    `SessionLive` when phase 7 shipped; it moved into the session dock's
    window with bd-9myzv8, and bd-a292yj added a second, ledger-backed figure
    in the window's info view — the HUD answers "what is this turn costing",
    the info view answers "what has this session cost", including after it
    ended.)

    `session.provider_session_id` / `.config_dir` are read as of the reader's
    own start rather than re-fetched every tick, but a mid-session rollover
    (§7.5's "wrinkle") is *not* left to the authoritative sweep: a rollover
    doesn't delete the old JSONL, so every tick with a known id also checks
    for a newer `*.jsonl` in the same config dir and switches onto it (and
    persists the new id) when one exists — the reader closes the gap itself,
    on the next ~2s tick, rather than going dark for the rest of the session.

  * **`arb usage --by session` / `--session <id>`.** `Arbiter.Usage.summarize/1`
    gained a `:session` grouping that mirrors `:task`'s discipline exactly:
    rows with no `session_id` are dropped rather than given a phantom group.
    `GET /api/usage/events` gained a `session_id` filter, and `arb usage
    --session <id>` is a new top-level flag (detected the same way
    `--calibration` already is) that drills into it — the same event-list
    renderer `arb usage events` uses, which now also prints `session=…` so
    the drill-down is legible without cross-referencing.

## 8. Auth modes and Remote Control (AC 10)

### 8.1 The two modes both already exist

`Arbiter.Agents.Claude.ConfigDir` branches on `oauth_token_configured?/1`
(`:169`), and `seed_links/1` (`:469`) implements the other side. What is new here
is **choosing per session** and being explicit about the trade.

| | **Mode A — workspace OAuth token** | **Mode B — seeded user credentials** |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from workspace `worker_env` | `.credentials.json` copied from the operator's config dir |
| Credential isolation | **Real** — revocable per workspace, distinct from the operator's login | **None** — it is the operator's own grant |
| Remote Control | **Unavailable** (silently — §8.3) | **Works** (measured: 546 bridge records) |
| Metering | Works (measured — §8.3 wrote usage locally) | Works, incl. while bridged (§7.2) |
| Use for | at-desk sessions, untrusted/bulk work | **the default**: any session the operator may need to reach AFK |

### 8.2 Mode B is primary (Amendment 2), and what "isolation" then means

Arbiter is LAN-only and stays that way; the host moves between tailnets; so when
the operator is away, **Remote Control is the only way to reach a session** — and
it needs no inbound ports and outsources remote auth to Anthropic. Since Remote
Control requires mode B (§8.3), **mode B is the default**, not the exception.

State plainly what per-session isolation therefore *is* and *is not*:

- **Not isolated:** the credential. Every mode-B session authenticates as the
  operator. A compromised or runaway session is indistinguishable, upstream, from
  the operator. Quota is shared and exhaustible by any session.
- **Still isolated:** the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — settings, permissions, MCP
  registration, session history, and the JSONL that meters it (which is what makes
  per-session metering work at all). The working directory. The MCP scope token.
  The memory layers mounted (§9.4).

One credential hazard to carry over, not re-learn: `ConfigDir` **copies** rather
than symlinks `.credentials.json`, because both sides refresh it and a symlink
would let a session write through and corrupt the operator's login (`:28`, and
`ConfigDir.remove_credentials/1`). Mode-B sessions multiply the number of
independent refreshers of one grant. §12 flags this.

### 8.3 Spike — `--remote-control` under an OAuth token

Predicted: refuses (operator's report). **Observed: worse — it succeeds silently
without a bridge.**

Setup: isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` with **no** `.credentials.json`, a valid
108-char `sk-ant-oat01…` workspace token, run under tmux to provide a TTY
(Claude Code v2.1.270).

| # | Configuration | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | token, `--print` | **Works.** Returned `SPIKE-OK`, rc=0 — the token is valid. |
| 2 | token, interactive, **fresh** config dir | Login wizard: theme picker → "Select login method" → OAuth URL requesting `…user:sessions:claude_code…`. |
| 3 | token, interactive, `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` seeded | **Works.** Reached a working prompt, "Sonnet 5 · Claude API". |
| 4 | token, interactive, seeded, **`--remote-control`** | **Starts normally. Ran a real turn successfully. Bridge never established.** |

The controls matter: run 2 would have "confirmed" the operator's report for the
wrong reason. The login wizard was a **fresh-config-dir artifact**, not an auth
fact — run 3 shows the token authenticates interactive sessions fine. So the
blocker is the *bridge*, specifically.

Evidence for run 4, measured rather than inferred from the banner:

```
bridge-session records in the session's JSONL : 0     (operator's mode-B session: 546)
bridge* keys in .claude.json                  : NONE  (operator's: bridgeOauthDeadExpiresAt, …)
oauthAccount present                          : False
assistant records carrying usage              : 1     ← metering still worked
```

Re-checked after a further 45 s: still 0. Mechanism: Remote Control needs a
`user:sessions:claude_code`-scoped **user** OAuth grant — the `bridgeOauth*` keys
in `.claude.json` are a separate grant from `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. A workspace
token does not carry it.

**Design consequences:**

1. `--remote-control` must be **disabled in the UI when mode A is selected**, with
   the reason shown. Offering a toggle that silently does nothing is the worst
   outcome.
2. When mode B + Remote Control is selected, Arbiter must **verify the bridge
   came up** — poll the session JSONL for a `bridge-session` record within a
   timeout and surface `bridge_unavailable` (§5.2 `error`) if absent. Never report
   "reachable remotely" on the strength of having passed a flag.
3. `--remote-control [name]` and `--remote-control-session-name-prefix` let
   Arbiter name sessions. The remote session title combines the operator-provided
   name with the Arbiter session id for traceability: `<name> · <first-8-chars-of-id>`
   when named, or just the full id when unnamed. This keeps the claude.ai session
   traceable back to its row while remaining readable.

## 9. Per-session provisioning (research task 5)

### 9.1 Layout

```
<sessions_root>/<session-id>/
  workspace/            # cwd for the agent; git worktrees created here
    .mcp.json           #   per-session scope token (§9.3) — lives in the cwd
  repo/                 # refine sessions only (§15): read-only detached worktree
  config/               # CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR  (isolated, per session)
    .claude.json        #   pre-seeded: onboarding + trust (§9.2)
    settings.json       #   ConfigDir.default_settings_json/0 (:443)
    .credentials.json   #   mode B only — copied, never symlinked
    projects/…/<sid>.jsonl   # the metering + transcript source (§7, §11)
  CLAUDE.md             # generated: role, workspace binding, guardrails
  memory/               # mounted layers + candidate space (§9.4)
  transcript/           # raw PTY byte stream (§11)
```

### 9.2 Pre-seeding is mandatory, and the spike found the exact gates

A fresh `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` **blocks on three interactive prompts** before the
agent is usable (§8.3 runs 2–3). In a browser terminal the operator would just see
a wizard; in an automated launch it hangs forever. The scaffold must pre-write:

| Gate | Key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Theme picker | `theme` | `<config>/.claude.json` |
| Login method wizard | `hasCompletedOnboarding: true`, `lastOnboardingVersion` | `<config>/.claude.json` |
| "Is this a folder you trust?" | project trust entry for the session cwd | `<config>/.claude.json` |

Verified working in the spike: seeding `hasCompletedOnboarding` took run 2's login
wizard to run 3's working prompt. This is a genuinely new requirement — workers
run `--print`, which never hits these gates, so `ConfigDir` does not seed them
today. It writes `settings.json` (`:443`) but not `.claude.json`. **Extend
`ConfigDir` with an interactive-session variant.**

#### 9.2.1 Two more gates, found on the first real launch (bd-5xlkkj)

Phase 5's post-merge live check watched a freshly provisioned session on the
real host (Claude Code 2.1.272). The three gates above were correctly
pre-answered — and the session still stopped twice:

| Gate | Key | Where |
|---|---|---|
| "New MCP server found in this project: arbiter" | `enabledMcpjsonServers: ["arbiter"]` | `<config>/settings.json` **and** `<config>/.claude.json` `projects.<cwd>` |
| "WARNING: Claude Code running in Bypass Permissions mode" | *none* — the session runs in `auto` mode instead | `<config>/settings.json` `permissions.defaultMode` |

Both gates only fire once the first three are answered, which is why the spike
never reached them. The MCP one is a plain omission. The bypass warning was a
consequence of the session inheriting `Arbiter.Agents.SecurityPolicy.default/0`
— the **headless worker's** posture, which is `bypassPermissions` because a
`--print` run freezes on a permission prompt nobody can answer. A session has
somebody at the keyboard, so `auto` is both the correct posture and one that
costs no acceptance screen. Sessions now resolve
`SecurityPolicy.interactive_session/0`, which also stops denying `Monitor` /
`ScheduleWakeup` — a coordinator session needs `Monitor` for the `/events`
stream (`docs/monitoring.md`), and the deny only ever made sense for `--print`
(bd-d534xo). Everything else in the worker baseline stays, including
`gh pr create` / `glab mr create`: the MergeQueue still owns PR creation
(bd-53xrmi).

### 9.3 MCP wiring — per-session, revocable

Reuse `Arbiter.MCP.AgentConfig.Claude.write_mcp_config/2`, which writes `.mcp.json`
with `"type" => "http"` pointing at the loopback MCP endpoint
(`apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/mcp/agent_config/claude.ex:48`). Unchanged.

**It goes in the session's cwd** (`workspace/`), not at the session root. Claude
Code auto-loads `.mcp.json` from the working directory only, and `launch.sh`
`cd`s into `workspace/` before `exec`ing the agent — a copy one level up is a
copy the session never reads, and the session would start with no Arbiter MCP
server registered at all. This corrects an earlier draft of the §9.1 tree above,
which drew it at the session root.

The token should be **per session and revocable**, not a shared coordinator token:
the session row is the natural revocation handle (killing a session revokes its
token), and per-session tokens make MCP audit rows attributable to the same
`session_id` the ledger uses. Mint at `--tier coordinator`, with
`workspace_id: nil` for the cross-workspace default and a bound `workspace_id`
for the opt-in single-workspace binding (decision 6) — `Arbiter.MCP.Scope` already
models exactly this (`scope.ex:17`).

`can_dispatch` (`scope.ex:20`) is already the documented recursion guardrail and
becomes a pre-launch toggle (§10).

### 9.4 Memory layers (Amendment 3 — decided; implementing, not re-opening)

Per the operator's decision ("a stale memory is worse"), a session mounts memory
**scoped by `metadata.type`**:

| Type | Mounted | Access | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user` | always, all sessions | read | who the operator is — behavioural, doesn't rot |
| `feedback` | always, all sessions | read | working doctrine — behavioural, doesn't rot |
| `reference` | always, all sessions | read | pointers to external resources |
| `project` | **only** the session's bound workspace | read | cites `file:line`/modules; rots fast; a vstim session must not load arbiter internals |

A `project` memory scopes to a workspace via its own `metadata.workspace_id`
frontmatter key (the workspace's id, matching `session.workspace_id`). A
`project` memory with no `workspace_id` mounts for no session — the safe
failure mode, per "a stale memory is worse" — rather than leaking into every
workspace's session.

**Shared layer is read-mostly.** A session never writes into it. Writes land in a
**per-session candidate space**, on disk at:

```
<sessions_root>/<session-id>/memory/candidates/*.md
```

with the mounted shared layers exposed read-only at
`<sessions_root>/<session-id>/memory/shared/` (bind-mount or symlink; symlink is
sufficient and simpler given the read-only convention is enforced by the generated
`CLAUDE.md`).

This is what makes concurrent sessions safe: `MEMORY.md` is one file edited
without locking, so two sessions writing at once is a last-write-wins clobber —
and decision 2 asks for multiple concurrent sessions, so this is a hard
requirement, not a nicety.

**Explicitly out of scope for this RFC** (per Amendment 3's scope note): the
promotion queue, the staleness checker that quarantines memories whose `file:line`
no longer resolves, and transcript distillation. They appear in the phase table
(§13) as their own children. This RFC builds only the scaffold: which layers
mount, read vs write, and where candidates land.

**Phase 13 (bd-19qve3)** builds the promotion queue and the staleness checker
(the explicit `memory_pending_*` MCP tools, content-anchored citation checks
run off the mount path, and quarantine instead of serve). That design, with
the seven amendments from its review, is in
[`docs/design/memory-promotion-queue.md`](design/memory-promotion-queue.md).

**Phase 14 (bd-avt4lt)** adds transcript distillation: a candidate generator,
never a writer of the shared layer (Amendment 3.5).
`Arbiter.Sessions.TranscriptDistillation` makes one bounded model pass over an
ended session's archived JSONL (§11). It does not read the raw PTY stream,
because Claude Code's TUI paints with cursor positioning, so that stream strips
down to run-together redraws. The model answers in JSON, and Arbiter renders
each candidate's frontmatter itself. It stamps `source_transcript` (the archive
path) and a `turn_range` checked against the window of numbered turns the model
was shown, and it drops anything it cannot anchor or that promotion would
refuse. Candidates land in the session's own `memory/candidates/`, so they get
the same `memory_pending_*` review as a session's own notes.

Scope (`max_bytes`, `from_turn`) and budget (`max_candidates`,
`max_output_tokens`, a per-pass `max_cost_usd` that the CLI enforces as
`--max-budget-usd`, and a rolling `daily_budget_usd` checked before any call)
come from `config :arbiter, :transcript_distillation`. Each pass is metered on
its own `usage_events` row (step `transcript_distillation`, source
`maintenance`), not on the distilled session. The coordinator triggers a pass
with the `memory_distill` MCP tool, whose bounds can only lower the configured
caps.

### 9.6 Status — phase 3 shipped (bd-aprlbb, #1684)

Provisioning is wired into `Arbiter.Sessions.launch/1`: the row is written, the
scaffold is built, then the scope starts. A provisioning failure aborts the
launch and ends the row rather than starting a pane that would hang.

| §9 item | Where it landed |
|---|---|
| 9.1 layout | `Arbiter.Sessions.Layout` (pure paths) + `Arbiter.Sessions.Provisioning` (creation) |
| 9.2 onboarding gates | `Arbiter.Agents.Claude.ConfigDir.Interactive` — merges into `.claude.json` rather than overwriting it, so Claude Code's own state (incl. `bridgeOauth*`) survives a re-provision |
| 9.3 MCP | `Arbiter.MCP.Scope.mint_session/2`; `.mcp.json` written mode `0600` into the session **cwd** via the existing `AgentConfig.Claude.write_mcp_config/2` |
| 9.4 memory | phase 3 shipped mount points only. **Phase 12** (bd-6dkpf1) fills them: `Arbiter.Sessions.Memory` mounts `memory/shared/<type>/` read-only by `metadata.type` — `user`/`feedback`/`reference` for every session, `project` filtered to the session's bound workspace, none for a cross-workspace session — reading a flat, frontmatter-tagged `*.md` source dir (`Arbiter.Config.Paths.memory_root/0`). Writes still land only in `memory/candidates/`. Promotion, staleness checking and distillation remain out of scope (§13) |
| generated instructions | `Arbiter.Sessions.Instructions` |

Two decisions worth carrying forward:

* **Revocation without a revocation table.** Scope tokens are stateless signed
  blobs, and §9.3 asks for a revocable one. Rather than add a table, the token
  carries a `session_id` claim and `Scope.from_token/1` refuses it when the row
  is ended or `mcp_token_revoked_at` is set. Killing a session therefore
  revokes its token by construction, and a token naming a session with no row
  is revoked rather than accepted. The cost is one indexed primary-key read per
  presented **session** token; worker and plain coordinator tokens never touch
  the database.
* **A launch wrapper, not a direct `claude` invocation.** §10.3 forbids a
  credential in argv, and the pane's command line *is* a `tmux -e` list. So
  provisioning writes `launch.sh` (mode `0700`) which sources `auth.env` (mode
  `0600`, mode A only) and `exec`s the agent. The only path in argv is a file
  the operator's user already owns.

§10.2 layers shipped: **1** (scaffolded cwd, and provisioning *refuses* a
sessions root inside the primary checkout rather than warning),
**3** (`Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` denies under the checkout in the session's
`settings.json`) and **4** (the generated `CLAUDE.md` names the path and the
rule). Layer **2** (worktrees, not the checkout) ships as instruction only —
there is no repo-work surface in phase 3 to enforce it at, and the session's
`workspace/` directory is the place those worktrees go.

### 9.5 Pre-launch UI (decision 5)

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| Provider | Claude Code |
| Auth mode (A/B) | **B** (§8.2) |
| Remote Control | on when mode B; **disabled with reason** when mode A (§8.3) |
| Workspace binding | cross-workspace; opt-in single workspace |
| `can_dispatch` | **off** (§10) |
| Model / effort | provider defaults |
| Session name | auto (`arb-session-<id>`), editable |
| Working dir | scaffolded (§9.1); choosing an existing checkout is **not** offered (§10) |

## 10. Security and blast radius (research task 6)

### 10.1 Hazard 1 — a session can restart the server hosting it

This is not hypothetical: the coordinator restarted arbiter twice on 2026-09-11
after merging core-app fixes.

The recommendation **converts this from fatal to routine**. Because the PTY is in
a sibling cgroup (§4.1), `systemctl --user restart arbiter` from inside a session
no longer kills that session. It drops the browser's channel; the session keeps
running; the client reconnects with `last_seq` and resumes (§5.3). The operator
sees a brief "reconnecting" state, not a dead terminal.

Remaining guards:

- **Restart recursion.** A session that restarts arbiter on a crash-loop can wedge
  the fleet. Rate-limit: refuse more than N restarts per window from session-origin
  callers, and surface it rather than failing silently.
- **Dispatch recursion.** Already modelled: `can_dispatch` (`scope.ex:20`) is the
  documented coordinator-only guardrail. Default **off**; on is a deliberate
  pre-launch choice.
- **Self-kill.** A session must not be able to terminate *its own* scope through
  Arbiter's API (it would kill the caller mid-call). Reject with a clear error;
  the operator kills it from the dashboard or the CLI.

### 10.2 Hazard 2 — reach into `/home/ryan/dev/arbiter`

Careless edits in the primary checkout have broken the running server before, via
Phoenix hot-reload picking up a half-written file.

Layered, because no single one of these is sufficient:

1. **Scaffold, never point at a checkout** (decision 4). The session's cwd is
   `<sessions_root>/<id>/workspace`, a fresh directory. The pre-launch UI does not
   offer "use an existing checkout" (§9.5).
2. **Worktrees, not the checkout.** Repo work happens in a git worktree created
   under the session root — the same discipline every dispatched worker follows.
3. **Deny-write on the primary checkout.** `ConfigDir.default_settings_json/0`
   (`:443`) already renders hardened settings from `Arbiter.Agents.Claude.Security`;
   extend that policy with a deny rule for writes under the primary `ARB_HOME`
   checkout. Cheap, and catches the accident case. As shipped this lives in
   `Arbiter.Agents.Claude.ConfigDir.Interactive.settings/1`, over the
   interactive profile rather than the worker one (§9.2.1).
4. **Generated `CLAUDE.md` states it** (§9.1). Belt and braces — the dispatched-
   worker prompt already carries this warning and it demonstrably helps.

Note honestly: (3) is a *guardrail*, not a sandbox. A session runs as the
operator's user and can reach anything that user can. Real confinement would need
a namespace/container boundary, which is a much larger change and would break the
session's ability to drive `mix`, `git` and `systemctl` — the things it exists to
do. The layered guards target **accidents**, which is the observed failure mode;
they are not a defence against a session acting adversarially.

### 10.3 Credentials reaching the session

Env vars, not proxy-injected headers — the proxy is gone (§2), and it is what
`ConfigDir.env/1` (`:151`) already does. Two rules:

- **Never on a command line.** `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is world-readable on this
  host, and this repo has a documented incident class around host-wide visible
  process command lines. Pass secrets via the environment or a mode-600 file read
  by the launch wrapper. (The spike did exactly this.)
- **Never in the transcript.** §11.

### 10.4 Loopback only (decision 8)

Bind the session socket to `127.0.0.1:4848` like the rest of the dashboard — this
is the default (bd-1c4pg3); an operator who overrides it with `ARB_BIND_ADDRESS`
gets a boot WARNING, since the socket has no login of its own. No new
remote-auth scheme is designed here; off-LAN access is Remote Control (§8) or an
SSH port-forward (`ssh -L 4848:127.0.0.1:4848 <host>`), which is why Amendment 2
makes it required rather than optional.

For temporary single-machine access over a network, forward the port using SSH
tunneling: see [docs/remote-access.md](remote-access.md).

## 11. Transcript persistence (research task 7)

Two different artefacts, both wanted, and conflating them is a mistake:

| | **Raw PTY stream** | **Session JSONL** |
|---|---|---|
| Source | `tmux pipe-pane -O` (§4.2) | Claude Code, `<config>/projects/<slug>/<sid>.jsonl` |
| Content | exactly what the operator saw, ANSI and all | structured turns, usage, thinking, tool IO |
| Good for | "what did the screen say", replay | analytics, metering, distillation |
| Location | `<sessions_root>/<id>/transcript/<id>.raw` | archived by bd-db0p38 |

**Relationship to existing artefacts.** Worker runs already produce
`<run_id>.log` (`Arbiter.Worker.OutputLog`, rendered, tool results truncated to 40
lines) and `worker_runs.output_lines` (1000-line tail). The session raw stream is
the analogue of the former but **untruncated**, because a coordinator session has
no run row to summarise into. The JSONL side needs no new machinery at all:
`Arbiter.Worker.SessionArchive` already archives session JSONLs, keyed by run id
— it needs a session-keyed entry point, not a new archiver.

**This is not optional plumbing — it is a deadline.** `docs/session-archive.md`
measured Claude Code pruning its session store at **~21 days**, with 45.2% of
runs carrying a `session_id` having already lost their file. A coordinator session
that is not archived is gone in three weeks, and with it the metering source of
truth and the distillation substrate.

**Size.** Measured on the operator's own sessions: **25 MB / 14,550 lines** for one
long interactive session; 2.2 MB / 1,242 lines for a shorter one. Subagent
transcripts nest separately under `<session-id>/subagents/*.jsonl` (124–208 KB
each in the sample) — session-level archiving must walk them too, as
`SessionArchive.subagents_dir_for/1` already contemplates. The raw PTY stream is
smaller than the JSONL (rendered text, no tool-input duplication) but unbounded in
principle; apply the archive's existing `max_bytes` cap.

**Redaction.** The raw stream captures whatever the screen showed, which can
include a token the operator pasted or a command that echoed a secret. Scrub on
write, and treat the transcript directory as mode-0700 operator-only data. This is
the same posture `docs/worker-security.md` takes. Because the PTY only hands
bytes over in whatever-sized chunks a poll tick catches, a secret can straddle
two chunks — an operator *typing* a key delivers it a few bytes per tick, so no
single chunk contains a full match. A fixed-size hold-back window doesn't fix
this: redaction only ever sees the *written* portion, so bytes held back are
never look-ahead for a match starting in what was already written — a token
typed slowly enough outlives any fixed window one byte at a time (bd-5pelo2,
round 2, finding 1). Cutting at *any* separator byte isn't safe either: two of
the seven patterns aren't unbroken token runs — `Bearer\s+<token>` contains a
space, and a PEM block spans newlines by construction — so a cut at, say, the
space inside `Bearer <token>` splits exactly the match it exists to protect
(bd-5pelo2, round 3, finding 1). Instead `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream` cuts only at
a **newline**: no supported pattern except the PEM block spans one, so a
same-line match (including `Bearer <token>`) is always wholly before the cut
or wholly after it. The PEM block gets its own guard on top — if the
candidate writable portion contains a `-----BEGIN` with no matching
`-----END` after it, the cut is pulled back to the start of that marker.
Both are bounded by the same hard cap so a run with no newline at all still
drains eventually (bd-5pelo2, round 2 finding 1; round 3 finding 1).

**Closed: capture now starts at session launch/adoption, not just first
attach.** `tmux pipe-pane -O` used to be started by `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream`
only on a browser's first attach, so a session nobody ever opened was never
captured at all. Round 3 attempted the obvious fix (`Stream.ensure_reader/2`,
called right after `mark_running/1` from both `Arbiter.Sessions.launch/1` and
`Arbiter.Sessions.Adoption`) and reverted it: `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream`'s
config — including which `Terminal` it uses — used to be fixed by whichever
call started the reader first, for the reader's whole life, so several
existing tests (`StreamTurnActivityTest` among them) that launch first and
only attach with `terminal: Arbiter.Test.ScriptedPty` afterwards broke: the
eager start locked the reader onto the real `Terminal.Tmux`, and the later
scripted `attach/2` talked to that already-wrong-terminal reader instead of
configuring a new one. Round 4 removed that constraint —
`reconfigure_if_mismatched/2` lets a reader started under one terminal be
reopened under another, as long as nobody has attached yet — which is what
makes it safe for `Arbiter.Sessions.start_scope/2` and `Arbiter.Sessions.Adoption`'s
reconcile loop to call `ensure_reader/2` right after `mark_running/1` again
(bd-5pelo2 round 5 finding 1): the launch-first-attach-with-a-different-terminal
tests above now pass because the later real `attach/2` reconfigures the eager
reader instead of being stuck behind it. An eager start that fails to open
(tmux not reachable yet at launch) is retried by the first real `attach/2`
rather than surfacing as a stale error to a caller who didn't cause it.

**Closed: an `arbiter` restart no longer drops the bytes written while no
reader was alive.** The moduledoc's claim that a restart "drops the reader
but never the session" is true of the pipe file (`tmux pipe-pane` keeps
appending to it regardless of whether anything is reading) but used to not be
true of the durable transcript: `open_stream/1` seeks to the pipe file's
*current* size before adopting it, so whatever the pane wrote between the old
reader dying and the new one adopting never reached `<id>.raw`.
`Arbiter.Sessions.Transcript.write_offset/2` (a sidecar file,
`<id>.raw.offset`) now persists the last pipe-file position the transcript
capture actually reached, and `Stream.catch_up_transcript/2` replays
`old_offset..new_base` through redaction before the reader goes live —
closing the gap for both a restart and a session's first-ever reader
(bd-5pelo2, round 4, finding 1). The persisted offset is the *written*
position, not the pipe position: the redaction hold-back buffer can be
sitting on up to 8 KB of not-yet-written tail at any given tick, and
persisting past it would claim those bytes were captured when they were not
(bd-5pelo2, round 5, finding 3).

## 12. Open questions and edge cases

1. **Credential refresh contention (mode B).** Several concurrent sessions each
   hold a *copy* of one `.credentials.json` and each may refresh it. `ConfigDir`
   copies precisely to stop a session corrupting the operator's file (`:28`), but
   whether N independent refreshers of one grant causes upstream rotation churn
   is **not established**. Worth a bounded experiment before running many
   concurrent mode-B sessions. Flagged, not designed around.
2. **Scrollback bound.** 30,000 lines is tmux's default. A week-long session in a
   build loop will exceed it. Raise per session, or accept that deep history lives
   in the transcript and the pane is a window?
3. **Detached-output replay fidelity.** `capture-pane` replays the *rendered pane*,
   so a full-screen TUI mid-redraw replays as its current state — correct, but a
   session in an alternate screen buffer (a pager, an editor) may need
   `-a`/alternate handling. Untested.
4. **Cost-state cadence.** 16 `cost-state` records across 14,550 lines — infrequent
   and evidently not on a fixed interval. The HUD's dollar figure will lag token
   counts. Acceptable, but the HUD should show "as of" rather than implying live
   dollars.
5. **Session-id rollover.** Compaction/`--resume` can change the provider session
   id mid-session (§7.5). The reconciler must follow it or silently stop metering.
6. **`hasUnknownModelCost`.** The cost-state record carries this flag; when true,
   the CLI's dollar figure is incomplete. Map it to the ledger's existing
   `cost_note` (`event.ex:189`) rather than writing a misleading `cost_usd`.
7. **Flaky connections.** Covered by seq-resume (§5.3), but the ring size (2 MB)
   is a guess; measure against a real session before fixing it. *Partly
   defused by phase 4* (§5.5 item 3): `seq` is a byte offset into the pipe
   file, so a reconnect outside the in-memory ring is still served from the
   file rather than repainted. The numbers are in `config/config.exs` under
   `Arbiter.Sessions.Stream` and are still guesses.
8. **Multiple browsers on one session.** tmux supports multi-client attach and
   `resize-window` makes size explicit, but two operators on one session will
   fight over dimensions. Suggested: first client owns size, others letterbox.
   *Decided in phase 4* (§5.5 item 4): the transport does last-writer-wins and
   tells every client the new geometry with `meta`; letterboxing, if wanted, is
   a frontend response to that event.

## 13. Phased implementation plan

Each phase is scoped to one child ticket.

| # | Phase | Scope | Pri | Diff |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Session lifecycle core** | `sessions` table + `Arbiter.Sessions` context; launch via `systemd-run --user --scope` + tmux; adoption sweep on boot; kill. No UI. Tests assert scope/socket naming and re-adoption. | 1 | 3 |
| 2 | **Restart-survival proof in CI** — *shipped (§4.9)* | An integration test that launches a session, restarts a stand-in unit, and asserts survival + gapless replay — the §4.2 spike as a regression test. Cheap, and protects the one property everything else assumes. | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | **Provisioning scaffold** | `arb init`-style per-session layout (§9.1); pre-seed the three onboarding gates (§9.2); `ConfigDir` interactive variant; `.mcp.json` + per-session scope token; mode A/B selection. | 1 | 3 |
| 4 | **Transport** — *shipped (§5.5)* | Socket + channel, full envelope (§5.2), seq ring, resume, backpressure. Tested headlessly against a scripted PTY — no browser needed. | 1 | 3 |
| 5 | **Frontend terminal** — *shipped (§6.4)* | Vendor xterm + canvas addon + CSS; colocated hook; fit/resize; copy-paste; `SessionLive` chrome. | 2 | 3 |
| 6 | **Metering ingest** | Extend `ClaudeSessionFile` to parse `cost-state` (fixes the moduledoc's stated cost gap, benefits workers too); `Sessions.UsageIngest` writing `source: :coordinator_session`; end-of-session reconcile; `session_id` index. | 1 | 3 |
| 7 | **Cost HUD + `arb usage --by session`** — *shipped (§7.9)* | Live `usage` channel events; HUD bar; CLI dimension + `--session` filter (§7.6). | 2 | 2 |
| 8 | **Remote Control integration** | Mode-B launch with `--remote-control <name>`; **bridge verification** via `bridge-session` polling (§8.3); UI disable-with-reason under mode A. | 2 | 2 |
| 9 | **Transcript persistence** | `pipe-pane` raw capture + redaction; session-keyed entry point on `SessionArchive`; subagent walk; retention. | 2 | 2 |
| 10 | **Orphan reaping + CLI fallback** — *shipped (§4.10)* | Idle-deadline sweep; in-scope dead-man's switch; `arb session list/attach` (§4.7). | 2 | 2 |
| 11 | **Pre-launch UI** | The §9.5 option set; guardrail defaults (`can_dispatch` off). | 3 | 2 |
| 12 | **Memory candidate space** — *shipped (§9.6)* | Type-scoped mounts + per-session candidate dir (§9.4) — scaffold only. | 2 | 2 |
| 13 | **Memory promotion + staleness checker** | *Separate ticket.* Promotion queue (`loop_pending_list`/`loop_pending_apply` as UI precedent), `file:line` verification, quarantine-not-serve. | 3 | 4 |
| 14 | **Transcript distillation** — *shipped (§9.4, bd-avt4lt)* | Candidate generator only, never a direct writer (Amendment 3.5): `Arbiter.Sessions.TranscriptDistillation`, triggered by the `memory_distill` MCP tool. Depends on 9 + 13. | 4 | 4 |

Phases 1–2 are the spine: if restart survival regresses, nothing else is worth
having. Phases 13–14 are deliberately outside this RFC per Amendment 3's scope
note.

## 14. Reuse map

| Existing code | `file:line` | Disposition | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Usage.Event` `@sources` (incl. `:coordinator_session`) | `apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/usage/event.ex:66` | **Reused as-is** | #1596 already added the discriminator; `:45` names this ticket as its writer. No migration. |
| `Usage.Event` `source` attribute | `…/usage/event.ex:130` | **Reused as-is** | Constraint already admits our value. |
| `Usage.Event` `session_id` attribute | `…/usage/event.ex:210` | **Reused as-is**, + one index | Attribution key. Add `[:session_id]` index for `--by session` (§7.4). |
| `Usage.Event` cache-token + `cost_note` attributes | `…/usage/event.ex:176`, `:180`, `:189` | **Reused as-is** | Cache-write/cache-read split already modelled — do not reinvent the pricing arithmetic (§7.4). `cost_note` carries `hasUnknownModelCost` (§12.6). |
| `ClaudeSessionFile.locate/2` | `…/usage/claude_session_file.ex:117` | **Reused as-is** | Globs `projects/*/<sid>.jsonl` under a config dir — exactly the per-session lookup. |
| `ClaudeSessionFile.read_totals/2` | `…/usage/claude_session_file.ex:148` | **Extended** | Dedupe-by-`message.id` and `:since` windowing are correct and load-bearing (§7.5). Extend to parse `cost-state` for `totalCostUSD`/`modelUsage` — its moduledoc's "no per-turn dollar figure" is true of `assistant` lines but **false of the file** (§7.4). Benefits worker reconciliation too. |
| `ConfigDir.oauth_token_configured?/1` (mode A branch) | `apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/agents/claude/config_dir.ex:169` | **Reused as-is** | Already the mode-A predicate; becomes a per-session choice rather than a global one (§8.1). |
| `ConfigDir.seed_links/2` (mode B branch) | `…/agents/claude/config_dir.ex:469` | **Reused as-is** | Copies (never symlinks) `.credentials.json` — the correct posture, and mode B is now the default (§8.2). |
| `ConfigDir.default_settings_json/0` | `…/agents/claude/config_dir.ex:443` | **Extended** | Writes hardened `settings.json`; extend the policy with a deny-write rule for the primary checkout (§10.2). |
| `ConfigDir.env/1` | `…/agents/claude/config_dir.ex:151` | **Reused as-is** | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` injection is exactly the isolation mode B still provides (§8.2). |
| *(no existing analogue)* — `.claude.json` onboarding/trust seeding | — | **New** | Workers use `--print` and never hit the interactive gates; sessions block on all three (§9.2). |
| `MCP.AgentConfig.Claude.write_mcp_config/2` (`"type" => "http"`) | `apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/mcp/agent_config/claude.ex:48` | **Reused as-is** | Per-session `.mcp.json` is the per-spawn case with a different token (§9.3). |
| `MCP.Scope` tiers / `can_dispatch` | `apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/mcp/scope.ex:17`, `:20` | **Reused as-is** | Already models workspace-agnostic coordinator tokens (decision 6) and the dispatch-recursion guardrail (§10.1). |
| `ClaudeSession.open_port/1` (`Port.open`, `--print`) | `apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/worker/claude_session.ex:1313` | **Not reused — parallel path** | Port-based, non-interactive, BEAM-owned: no PTY (so no TUI), and BEAM-owned lifetime fails restart survival (§4.4). Worker dispatch keeps it unchanged; sessions take the systemd+tmux path. Its env-injection discipline (`:1354`) is still the reference for §10.3. |
| `Worker.record_usage_event/3` | `apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/worker.ex:1414` | **Pattern reused, not the code** | Parses the `--print` terminal `result` event, which an interactive session never emits. Sessions use JSONL ingest (§7.1); the ledger-write shape is the model to copy. |
| Claude Code `cost-state` / `usage` / `bridge-session` JSONL records | `<config>/projects/<slug>/<sid>.jsonl` (samples in §7.2) | **New consumer of an existing format** | The metering substrate and the bridge-verification signal (§8.3). |
| `Worker.SessionArchive` | `apps/arbiter/lib/arbiter/worker/session_archive.ex:181`, `:137` | **Extended** | Already archives session JSONLs incl. a subagents dir, keyed by run id; needs a session-keyed entry point (§11). |
| `arb usage` `--by` / `--source` | `apps/arbiter_cli/lib/arbiter_cli/cmd/usage.ex:13`, `:19`, `:32` | **Extended** | `--by source` and `--source coordinator_session` already exist; add `session` (§7.6), following the documented "`--by task` excludes sessionful sources" precedent. |
| `.LogStreamStick` colocated hook | `apps/arbiter_web/lib/arbiter_web/components/core_components/domain.ex:578` | **Pattern reused** | The repo's precedent for a hook owning scroll behaviour on live output (§6.3). |
| esbuild config / vendored JS | `config/config.exs:160`; `apps/arbiter_web/assets/vendor/`, `js/app.js:26` | **Reused as-is** | No `package.json` exists; xterm is vendored like `topbar` (§6.1). |
| `Quota.worker_base_url/1` / metering proxy | *removed in #1605* | **Gone — deliberately not cited** | Per Amendment 4. §7.3 records why re-adding it loses to JSONL ingestion. |

## 15. Refine sessions (bd-cksar2)

A session bound to one Backlog issue, launched from that issue's **Refine**
action, so the operator and an agent can shape it into a dispatchable ticket
together. Everything above still applies — this section is only the deltas.

| | A coordinator session | A refine session |
|---|---|---|
| Launched from | `/sessions`, or the dock's New session | An issue's Refine action (detail page, board card) |
| Row | `issue_id` null | `issue_id` set; a partial unique index (`WHERE status != 'ended'`) allows one live row per issue |
| Token (§9.3) | `:coordinator`, workspace-bound or cross-workspace | `:refine`, bound to the issue *and* its workspace, `can_dispatch` hard-wired off (bd-3uy2hn) |
| Instructions (§9.1) | one generated `CLAUDE.md` at the session root | the refine variant, in the **cwd**, as `CLAUDE.md` *and* `AGENTS.md` (bd-980x89) |
| Repo | none — §10.2 layer 1 is "scaffold, never point at a checkout" | a **read-only** detached `git worktree` at `<root>/repo`, for grep and read grounding only |
| Model | whatever the CLI picks | the workspace's `premium` tier model at thinking `high` (`--effort high`, or whatever the workspace's `agent.config["thinking_argv"]` remaps that level to) — never flagship, and the routing policies are never consulted |

The **checkout** is the one new thing on disk, and it is deliberately the
weakest thing that serves reading (`Arbiter.Sessions.RepoCheckout`):

  * Detached at the tip of the repo's default branch, resolved locally with
    `rev-parse` — never fetched. An interactive launch must not hang on the
    network for a freshness nobody asked for.
  * Every write bit stripped, directories included, so `mix`, `git commit` and
    a stray editor write all fail with `EACCES`.
  * Under the session root, so §10.2 layer 1 covers it: it is asserted to be
    outside the primary checkout, and it is *never* the tree the server runs
    from.
  * Removed by `Sessions.mark_ended/2`, which is every way a session ends —
    Kill, the agent exiting, the idle reaper, the adoption sweep.

An issue with no repo, or one naming a repo the workspace never registered in
`repo_paths`, simply gets no checkout: the launch succeeds and the instructions
say there is none, rather than failing the operator's click over a gap in
config.
