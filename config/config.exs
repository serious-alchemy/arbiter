# Quota-aware dispatch throttle (bd-7cd38f). Governs what the fleet dispatcher
# does when the workspace nears / crosses the Anthropic 5h quota cap, consuming
# the quota snapshots `Arbiter.Quota.CloudProbe` polls off `/api/oauth/usage`
# (bd-b0zody; the pass-through proxy that used to capture the same figures off
# response headers was removed in bd-7cvh8z):
#
#   * on_exhaustion: :throttle (default) — near the cap, HOLD new dispatches in a
#     per-workspace draining queue and drain them in priority order as headroom
#     frees / the 5h window resets. Work is delayed, never dropped.
#   * on_exhaustion: :continue — dispatch proceeds past the cap (paid API
#     overage); overage spend is recorded and an alert fires once per
#     `overage_alert_usd` crossing, but dispatch never auto-stops.
#
# `throttle_threshold` is the `utilization_5h` at/above which :throttle holds
# (0.85 = Ryan's hand-enforced ceiling, between the dashboard's 0.7/0.9 bands).
# `overage_alert_usd` is the global default alert threshold for :continue, below
# a per-workspace `quota.overage_alert_usd` override.
#
# Per-workspace overrides live in `workspace.config["quota"]`; precedence is
# per-workspace > this global default > the hardcoded `:throttle`. Set
# `:gate` to a module to hard-override the gate (kill switch / tests).
#
# Staleness (optional overrides): `staleness_threshold_seconds` (default 300)
# and `polled_staleness_threshold_seconds` (default 1200) are how old a
# header-captured / polled snapshot the gate still trusts before the 5h window
# fails open; `stale_alert_threshold_seconds` (default 1800) is when
# `Arbiter.Quota.StalenessWatch` raises the "quota accounting is blind" alert.

# Quota-bar colours (bd-clzkvp) have no config of their own: each bar is

# settings — `paced_floor` / `weekly_paced_floor` in an account's
# `quota_config` or a workspace's `config["quota"]` — are what move them.

# Direct Gemini CLI + Antigravity quota tracking (bd-57ukgb). Unlike the
# Anthropic snapshot (passively captured by the proxy), these fetch live from
# Google's Cloud Code Assist API when `GET /api/quota` / `arb quota` / the MCP
# `quota_get` tool is invoked. Enabled by default; `config/test.exs` turns it
# off so the quota surface stays a pure DB read under test.

# Periodic refresh of the non-Anthropic quota providers (Codex, Gemini CLI,

# broadcasts a quota_updated event; `GET /api/quota` then reads the persisted
# rows rather than fetching live. `config/test.exs` turns it off.
